Exploring the impact of Artificial Intelligence and robots on higher education through literature-based design fictions,Artificial Intelligence; AI; Robots; Social robots; Learning analytics; Big data; AIEd; Design fiction,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics are likely to have a significant long-term impact on higher education (HE). The scope of this impact is hard to grasp partly because the literature is siloed, as well as the changing meaning of the concepts themselves. But developments are surrounded by controversies in terms of what is technically possible, what is practical to implement and what is desirable, pedagogically or for the good of society. Design fictions that vividly imagine future scenarios of AI or robotics in use offer a means both to explain and query the technological possibilities. The paper describes the use of a wide-ranging narrative literature review to develop eight such design fictions that capture the range of potential use of AI and robots in learning, administration and research. They prompt wider discussion by instantiating such issues as how they might enable teaching of high order skills or change staff roles, as well as exploring the impact on human agency and the nature of datafication."
Teachers' Views Regarding Learning Analytics Usage Based on the Technology Acceptance Model,Learning analytics; School education; Teacher professional development; Technology acceptance,BIG DATA; USER ACCEPTANCE; ENVIRONMENTS; BELIEFS; SUPPORT,"The article is focusing on aspects related to technology acceptance of LA in the context of school education. A survey that was based on the Technology Acceptance Model was distributed to 98 participants who work as schoolteachers and/or local educational policymakers and are geographically dispersed across two different European countries. The survey comprised of questions that span across four broad categories: a) actual usage of LA in schools, b) intention to use LA, c) perceived usefulness, and d) attitudes towards use. Regarding (a), most of the participants were aware that their educational institutions retain and use digital formats of student data as well as other data relevant to the learning process. Also, the participants could verify the existence of a respective privacy policy in their educational institutions. With respect to the perceived usefulness aspect, the participants were asked to opinionate concerning four promising types of LA usage, namely 1) real-time feedback, 2) prediction of at-risk students, 3) learning activities recommendation, and 4) student groups recommendation. All four types were well-received, but the perceived usefulness of prediction of at-risk students scored lower than the other three types of activities, while the learning activities recommendation scored higher in terms of perceived usefulness. The participants' intention to use LA was examined in conjunction with their professionalism and that prospect was also well-received. The results are partially controversial, since the participants' attitudes were not particularly favorable: they are moderate with respect to how much sceptic, willing and ready they feel about embarking on a LA endeavor."
Is New Zealand's Higher Education Sector Ready to Employ Analytics Initiatives to Enhance its Decision-making Process?,Analytics; Higher education; Decision-making; Challenges,LEARNING ANALYTICS; BIG DATA; CHALLENGES; BENEFITS,"Interest in the use of analytics to support evidence-based decision-making in higher education is relatively a new phenomenon. The available research suggests that analytics can enhance an institution's ability to make evidence-based informed decisions that foster growth and increased productivity. The present study explored how institutions of higher education in New Zealand value and utilise analytics to enhance the quality of decision-making. The study involved administering an online questionnaire (n = 82) to senior administrators from seven of the eight research-intensive public universities in New Zealand. Key findings revealed that the use of analytics in the higher education sector could enhance the quality of decision-making. Respondents reported that the use of analytics is likely to advance operational and strategic decisions by monitoring and efficiently optimising the use of resources. Respondents said that analytics provide better planning of issues about students (e.g. enrolment, retention, and completion rate). Furthermore, analytics can improve institutional research administration (e.g. performance outcomes in finance and human resources). Despite the stated benefits of analytics in enhancing decision-making in many operational and strategic areas, the study found that the use of analytics in the higher education sector in New Zealand is limited to monitoring operational activities, rather than improving the quality of learning, teaching and strategic initiatives. Further, the study identified several concerns regarding the ability of institutions to find the capacity and expertise to extract useful information from the available data sets and to turn such data into usable knowledge to support students and educators. Also, respondents were concerned that the lack of staff capacity and training to use analytics effectively could be detrimental. Others feared that analytics could be used as surveillance tools and enforce compliance and control. It was mentioned that over-reliance on analytics could easily lead to a breach of individuals' and institutional privacy, which is a threat to information and data security. Also, there was a concern that analytics could be used to perpetuate inequity and inequality among and within institutions. Results of the study presented in this article serve as a baseline for future studies about the use of analytics in the higher education sector in New Zealand. Additionally, it contributes to the growing debate about the value and challenges of deploying analytics and Big Data in the higher education sector worldwide."
Enhanced Harris Hawks optimization as a feature selection for the prediction of student performance,Harris Hawks optimization; Student performance; Population diversity; Educational data mining,LEARNING ANALYTICS; EXPLORATION; ALGORITHMS,"Predicting student performance for educational organizations such as universities, community colleges, schools, and training centers will enhance the overall results of these organizations. Big data can be extracted from the internal systems of these organizations, such as exam records, statistics about virtual courses, and e-learning systems. Finding meaningful knowledge from extracted data is a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed a modified version of Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm by controlling the population diversity to overcome the early convergence problem and prevent trapping in a local optimum. The proposed approach is employed as a feature selection algorithm to discover the most valuable features for student performance prediction problem. A dynamic controller that controls the population diversity by observing the performance of HHO using the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm as a clustering approach. Once all solutions belong to one cluster, an injection process is employed to redistribute the solutions over the search space. A set of machine learning classifiers such as kNN, Layered recurrent neural network (LRNN), Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural Network are used to evaluate the overall prediction system. A real dataset obtained from UCI machine learning repository is adopted in this paper. The obtained results show the importance of predicting students' performance at an earlier stage to avoid students' failure and improve the overall performance of the educational organization. Moreover, the reported results show that the combination between the enhanced HHO and LRNN can outperform other classifiers with accuracy equal to 92%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$92\%$$\end{document}, since LRNN is a deep learning algorithm that is able to learn from previous and current input values."

A Fine-Grained Model to Assess Learner-Content and Methodology Satisfaction in Distance Education,E-learning; Learning Management System; Learning Analytics; Student's Success; User Monitoring,STUDENTS SATISFACTION; MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; BIG DATA; QUALITY; PERSPECTIVE; EXPERIENCE; TEACHERS,"Learning Management System (LMS) platforms have led to a transformation in Universities in the last decade. helping them to adapt and expand their services to new technological challenges. These platforms have made possible the expansion of distance education. A current trend in this area is focused on the evaluation and improvement of the students' satisfaction. In this work a new tool to assess student satisfaction using emoticons (smileys) is proposed to evaluate the quality of the learning content and the methodology at unit level for any course and at any time. The results indicate that the assessment of student satisfaction is sensitive to the period when the survey is performed and to the student's study level. Moreover, the results of this new proposal are compared to the satisfaction results using traditional surveys, showing different results due to a more accuracy and flexibility when using the tool proposed in this work."
An Exploration of Factors Linked to Academic Performance in PISA 2018 Through Data Mining Techniques,educational data mining; school performance; large-scale assessment; non-cognitive outcomes; socioeconomic status; decision tree; academic achievement,MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; READING ENGAGEMENT; HONG-KONG; SCHOOL; STUDENTS; MATHEMATICS; ACHIEVEMENT; PROGRAM; SCIENCE; LITERACY,"International large-scale assessments, such as PISA, provide structured and static data. However, due to its extensive databases, several researchers place it as a reference in Big Data in Education. With the goal of exploring which factors at country, school and student level have a higher relevance in predicting student performance, this paper proposes an Educational Data Mining approach to detect and analyze factors linked to academic performance. To this end, we conducted a secondary data analysis and built decision trees (C4.5 algorithm) to obtain a predictive model of school performance. Specifically, we selected as predictor variables a set of socioeconomic, process and outcome variables from PISA 2018 and other sources (World Bank, 2020). Since the unit of analysis were schools from all the countries included in PISA 2018 (n = 21,903), student and teacher predictor variables were imputed to the school database. Based on the available student performance scores in Reading, Math, and Science, we applied k-means clustering to obtain a categorized (three categories) target variable of global school performance. Results show the existence of two main branches in the decision tree, split according to the schools' mean socioeconomic status (SES). While performance in high-SES schools is influenced by educational factors such as metacognitive strategies or achievement motivation, performance in low-SES schools is affected in greater measure by country-level socioeconomic indicators such as GDP, and individual educational indicators are relegated to a secondary level. Since these evidences are in line and delve into previous research, this work concludes by analyzing its potential contribution to support the decision making processes regarding educational policies."
A Learning Analytics Theoretical Framework for STEM Education Virtual Reality Applications,virtual reality; learning analytics; STEM education; instructional design,STUDENT ENGAGEMENT; SCIENCE; SYSTEMS; ONLINE,"While virtual reality has attracted educators' interest by providing new opportunities to the learning process and assessment in different science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, the results from previous studies indicate that there is still much work to be done when large data collection and analysis is considered. At the same time, learning analytics emerged with the promise to revolutionise the traditional practices by introducing new ways to systematically assess and improve the effectiveness of instruction. However, the collection of 'big' educational data is mostly associated with web-based platforms (i.e., learning management systems) as they offer direct access to students' data with minimal effort. Thence, in the context of this work, we present a four-dimensional theoretical framework for virtual reality-supported instruction and propose a set of structural elements that can be utilised in conjunction with a learning analytics prototype system. The outcomes of this work are expected to support practitioners on how to maximise the potential of their interventions and provide further inspiration for the development of new ones."
Fostering Evidence-Based Education with Learning Analytics: Capturing Teaching-Learning Cases from Log Data,Learning analytics; Evidence-based education; Technology-enhanced Evidence-based Education & Learning (TEEL); Learning Evidence Analytics Framework (LEAF); Mixed effects model; Teaching-learning case,IMPROVE,"Evidence-based education has become more relevant in the current technology-enhanced teaching-learning era. This paper introduces how Educational BIG data has the potential to generate such evidence. As evidence-based education traditionally hooks on the meta-analysis of the literature, so there are existing platforms that support manual input of evidence as structured information. However, such platforms often focus on researchers as end-users and its design is not aligned to the practitioners' workflow. In our work, we propose a technology-mediated process of capturing teaching-learning cases (TLCs) using a learning analytics framework. Each case is primarily a single data point regarding the result of an intervention and multiple such cases would generate an evidence of intervention effectiveness. To capture TLCs in our current context, our system automatically conducts statistical modelling of learning logs captured from Learning Management Systems (LMS) and an e-book reader. Indicators from those learning logs are evaluated by the Linear Mixed Effects model to compute whether an intervention had a positive learning effect. We present two case studies to illustrate our approach of extracting case effectiveness from two different learning contexts - one at a junior-high math class where email messages were sent as intervention and another in a blended learning context in a higher education physics class where an active learning strategy was implemented. Our novelty lies in the proposed automated approach of data aggregation, analysis, and case storing using a Learning Analytics framework for supporting evidence-based practice more accessible for practitioners."
Evaluation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Sustainable Postgraduate Medical Training: An Opportunity for Implementing an Innovative Approach to Advance the Quality of Training Programs at the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS),key performance indicators (KPIs); attitudes; training programs; Saudi Commission for Health Specialties; framework; best practices; healthcare; medical training; residents; postgraduate medical training; learning analytics; artificial intelligence (AI),LEARNING ANALYTICS; HIGHER-EDUCATION; SEXUAL-HARASSMENT; BURNOUT; RESIDENTS; DISCRIMINATION; PERCEPTIONS; PHYSICIANS; STUDENTS; SYSTEMS,"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is undergoing a major transformation in response to a revolutionary vision of 2030, given that healthcare reform is one of the top priorities. With the objective of improving healthcare and allied professional performance in the Kingdom to meet the international standards, the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) has recently developed a strategic plan that focuses on expanding training programs' capacity to align with the increasing demand for the country's healthcare workforce, providing comprehensive quality assurance and control to ensure training programs uphold high quality standards, and providing advanced training programs benchmarked against international standards. In this research paper, we describe our attempt for developing a general framework for key performance indicators (KPIs) and the related metrics, with the aim of contributing to developing new strategies for better medical training compatible with the future. We present the results of a survey conducted in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), for the enhancement of quality of postgraduate medical training. The recent developments in the field of learning analytics present an opportunity for utilizing big data and artificial intelligence in the design and implementation of socio-technical systems with significant potential social impact. We summarize the key aspects of the Training Quality Assurance Initiative and suggest a new approach for designing a new data and services ecosystem for personalized health professionals training in the KSA. The study also contributes to the theoretical knowledge on the integration of sustainability and medical training and education by proposing a framework that can enhance future initiatives from various health organizations."
Educational Technology Research Patterns in the Realm of the Digital Knowledge Age,educational technology; EdTech; digital knowledge age; the evolution of EdTech; research patterns,LEARNING TECHNOLOGY; RESEARCH TRENDS; FUTURE; TEACHERS; DECADES; DESIGN; COMMUNICATION; PUBLICATIONS; REFLECTIONS; CLASSROOM,"Educational technology (EdTech) is a dynamic, evolving field and as such, in identifying and mapping research patterns in this field, a systematic approach is required. Starting from when the World Wide Web became publicly available, this study conducts a systematic review of educational technology research patterns. The review showed that after 1993, there was a sudden increase in the number of educational technology publications, and that in terms of subject areas, social sciences dominate the field, which suggests that there is a need for more interdisciplinary research. Regarding the geographical distribution of the research, the review found that most of the contributions come from the same developed countries. The following themes from over the course of almost three decades were identified: 1993-1999 multimedia learning and instructional design; 2000-2004 convergence of educational technology, distance education and online learning environments, and educational technology integration in traditional learning settings; 2005-2009 revising curriculum for educational technology, educational technology in higher education and distance education, and the bottleneck of the significant differences in educational technology research; 2010-2014 online learning and higher education, integration of ICT and full potential of educational technology; and 2015-2019 data-driven, smart educational technology, big data, and learning analytics. While critical views are increasing, this study also observed that some discourse, such as arguments that EdTech will change education and replace teachers, are constantly articulated throughout the literature."
Visual analytics of video-clickstream data and prediction of learners' performance using deep learning models in MOOCs' courses,deep learning (LSTM); MOOCs courses; prediction; video-clickstream; visual analytics,,"The big data stored in massive open online course (MOOC) platforms have become a posed challenge in the Learning Analytics field to analyze the learning behavior of learners, and predict their respective performance, related especially to video lecture data, since most learners view the same online lecture videos. This helps to conduct a comprehensive analysis of such behaviors and explore various learning patterns in MOOC video interactions. This paper aims at presenting a visual analysis, which enables course instructors and education experts to analyze clickstream data that were generated by learner interaction with course videos. It also aims at predicting learner performance, which is a vital decision-making problem, by addressing their issues and improving the educational process. This paper uses a long short-term memory network (LSTM) on implicit features extracted from video-clickstreams data to predict learners' performance and enable instructors to make measures for timely intervention. Results show that the accuracy rate of the proposed model is 89%-95% throughout course weeks. The proposed LSTM model outperforms baseline Deep learning (GRU) and simple recurrent neural network by accuracy of 90.30% in the Mining of Massive Datasets course, and the Automata Theory accuracy is 89%."
Open Learner Models Working in Symbiosis With Self-Regulating Learners: A Research Agenda,Open learner models; Trace data; Self-regulated learning; Learning analytics,ANALYTICS; OUTCOMES,"Learner modeling systems so far formulated model learning in three main ways: a learner's position within a lattice of declarative and procedural knowledge about highly structured disciplines such as geometry or physics, a learner's path through curricular tasks compared to milestones, or profiles of a learner's achievements on a set of tasks relative to mastery criteria or a peer group. Opening these models to learners identifies for them factors and relations among factors. Open learner models tacitly invite learners to regulate learning. However, contemporary learner models omit data about how learners have and should process information to learn, understand, consolidate and transfer new knowledge and skills. What to do with information opened to learners is opaque. I propose incorporating trace data about learning processes in learner models. Trace data allow generating learning analytics that inform self-regulating learners about potentially productive adaptations to processes they have used to learn. In a context of big data, such elaborated learner models are positioned to collaborate with self-regulating learners. Together, they can coordinate symbiotically, creating a platform for the system to improve its models of learners and for learners to more productively self-regulate learning."

Through the correlation analysis among learning interaction activities, this paper discusses the potential association rules, defines the data structures, mines the frequent item sets, and designs appropriate algorithms, then recommend learning decision makings based on association rules. The research methods and conclusions can provide feasible educational decision makings for the realization of personalization, probability prediction and decision feedback, which will improve the interactive learning environment, the algorithms, methods and modes designed in this paper are useful supplements for learning analytics."
ARCS-Assisted Teaching Robots Based on Anticipatory Computing and Emotional Big Data for Improving Sustainable Learning Efficiency and Motivation,sustainable learning; robot-assisted teaching; ARCS model; anticipatory computing; artificial intelligence; emotional big data,,"Under the vigorous development of global anticipatory computing in recent years, there have been numerous applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in people's daily lives. Learning analytics of big data can assist students, teachers, and school administrators to gain new knowledge and estimate learning information; in turn, the enhanced education contributes to the rapid development of science and technology. Education is sustainable life learning, as well as the most important promoter of science and technology worldwide. In recent years, a large number of anticipatory computing applications based on AI have promoted the training professional AI talent. As a result, this study aims to design a set of interactive robot-assisted teaching for classroom setting to help students overcoming academic difficulties. Teachers, students, and robots in the classroom can interact with each other through the ARCS motivation model in programming. The proposed method can help students to develop the motivation, relevance, and confidence in learning, thus enhancing their learning effectiveness. The robot, like a teaching assistant, can help students solving problems in the classroom by answering questions and evaluating students' answers in natural and responsive interactions. The natural interactive responses of the robot are achieved through the use of a database of emotional big data (Google facial expression comparison dataset). The robot is loaded with an emotion recognition system to assess the moods of the students through their expressions and sounds, and then offer corresponding emotional responses. The robot is able to communicate naturally with the students, thereby attracting their attention, triggering their learning motivation, and improving their learning effectiveness."
Data-driven educational algorithms pedagogical framing,teaching practice; learning conditions; sciences of education; experimental education; educational research; electronic data processing,BIG DATA; LEARNING ANALYTICS,"Data from students and learning practices are essential for feeding the artificial intelligence systems used in education. Recurrent data trains the algorithms so that they can be adapted to new situations, either to optimize coursework or to manage repetitive tasks. As the algorithms spread in different learning contexts and the actions which they perform expand, pedagogical interpretative frameworks are required to use them properly. Based on case analyses and a literature review, the paper analyses the limits of learning practices based on the massive use of data from a pedagogical approach. The focus is on data capture, biases associated with datasets, and human intervention both in the training of artificial intelligence algorithms and in the design of machine learning pipelines. In order to facilitate the adequate use of data-driven learning practices, it is proposed to frame appropriate heuristics to determine the pedagogical suitability of artificial intelligence systems and also their evaluation both in terms of accountability and of the quality of the teaching-learning process. Thus, finally, a set of top-down proposed rules that can contribute to fill the identified gaps to improve the educational use of data-driven educational algorithms is discussed."
Advanced Learning Analytics in Academic Education: Academic Performance Forecasting Based on an Artificial Neural Network,Academic Evaluation; Decision Support Systems; Key Performance Indicator; Neural Networks,DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; BIG DATA; STUDENT; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT,"The integration of innovative data mining and decision-making techniques in the context of higher education is a bold initiative towards enhanced performance. Predictive and descriptive analytics add interesting insights for significant aspects the education. The purpose of this article is to summarize a novel approach for the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques towards forecasting of academic performance. The added value of applying AI techniques for advanced decision making in education is the realization that the scientific approach to standard problems in academia, like the enhancement of academic performance is feasible. For the purpose of this research the authors promote a research in Saudi Arabia. The vision of the Knowledge Society in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a critical milestone towards digital transformation. The human capital and the integration of industry and academia has to be based on holistic approaches to skills and competencies management. One of the main objectives of an academic decision maker is to ensure that academic resources are adequately planned and that students are properly advised. To achieve such an objective, an extensive analysis of large volumes of data may be required. This research develops a decision support system (DSS) that is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) model that can be deployed for effective academic planning and advising. The system is based on evaluating academic metrics against academic performance for students. The model integrates inputs from relevant academic data sources into an autonomous ANN. A simulation of real data on an ANN is conducted to validate the system's accuracy. Moreover, an ANN is compared with different mathematical approaches. The system enables the quality assurance of planning, advising, and the monitoring of academic decisions. The overall contribution of this work is a novel approach to the deployment of Artificial Intelligent for advanced decision making in higher education. In future work this model is integrated with big data and analytics research for advanced visualizations"
Library analytics as moral dilemmas for academic librarians,Library analytics; Surveillance; Big data; Moral dilemmas; Academic libraries,LEARNING ANALYTICS; PRIVACY; NUDGE,"Library analytics in academic libraries, especially in the United States, are part of the expanding web of societywide surveillance. The use of library analytics systems poses serious threats to the well-being of many actors, especially students. Academic librarians are faced with new moral challenges by such systems as described here and must determine the extent to which they wish to participate in the surveillance of students for whom they are responsible. The column concludes with some recommendations from the literature and with consideration of the roles of free inquiry, freedom from surveillance, and exercise of autonomy essential to higher education and full citizenship."
Introducing innovative technologies in higher education: An experience in using geographic information systems for the teaching-learning process,enhanced science and engineering education; experiential learning; geographic information systems; innovative technologies; learning analytics,GIS EDUCATION; SPATIAL THINKING; STUDENTS; SCIENCE,"In today's world, new technologies are being used for the teaching-learning process in the classroom. Their use to support learning can provide significant advantages for the teaching-learning process and have potential benefits for students, as many of these technologies are a part of the work life of many current professions. The aim of this study is to analyse the use of innovative technologies for engineering and science education after examining the data obtained from students in their learning process and experiences. The study has been focused on computational geographic information systems, which allow access to and management of large volumes of information and data, and on the assessment of this tool as a basis for a suitable methodology to enhance the teaching-learning process, taking into account the great social impact of big data. The results allow identifying the main advantages, opportunities, and drawbacks of using these technological tools for educational purposes. Finally, a set of initiatives has been proposed to complement the teaching activity and to improve user experience in the educational field."
Reporting Writing Process Feedback in the Classroom Using Keystroke Logging Data to Reflect on Writing Processes,process feedback; writing processes; keystroke logging; self-assessment; writing from sources,FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT; LEARNING ANALYTICS; STUDENTS; MODEL; BELIEFS; TRANSLATION; PRINCIPLES; EXEMPLARS; SUPPORT; PRODUCT,"Keystroke loggers facilitate researchers to collect fine-grained process data and offer support in analyzing these data. Keystroke logging has become popular in writing research, and study by study we are now paving the path to a better understanding of writing process data. However, few researchers have concentrated on how to bring keystroke logging to the classroom. Not because they are not convinced that writing development could benefit from a more process-oriented pedagogy, but because 'translating' complex and large data sets to an educational context is challenging. Therefore, we have developed a new function in Inputlog, specifically aiming to facilitate writing tutors in providing process feedback to their students. Based on an XML- logfile, the so-called 'report' function automatically generates a pdf-file addressing different perspectives of the writing process: pausing, revision, source use, and fluency. These perspectives are reported either quantitatively or visually. Brief introductory texts explain the information presented. Inputlog provides a default feedback report, but users can also customize the report. This paper describes the process report and demonstrates the use of it in an intervention. We also present some additional pedagogical scenarios to actively use this type of feedback in writing classes."
Fueling Prediction of Player Decisions: Foundations of Feature Engineering for Optimized Behavior Modeling in Serious Games,Feature selection; Feature engineering; Educational data mining; Behavior modeling; Game-based learning; Serious games,,"As a digital learning medium, serious games can be powerful, immersive educational vehicles and provide large data streams for understanding player behavior. Educational data mining and learning analytics can effectively leverage big data in this context to heighten insight into student trajectories and behavior profiles. In application of these methods, distilling event-stream data down to a set of salient features for analysis (i.e. feature engineering) is a vital element of robust modeling. This paper presents a process for systematic game-based feature engineering to optimize insight into player behavior: the IDEFA framework (Integrated Design of Event-stream Features for Analysis). IDEFA aligns game design and data collection for high-resolution feature engineering, honed through critical, iterative interplay with analysis. Building on recent research in game-based data mining, we empirically investigate IDEFA application in serious games. Results show that behavioral models which used a full feature set produced more meaningful results than those with no feature engineering, with greater insight into impactful learning interactions, and play trajectories characterizing groups of players. This discovery of emergent player behavior is fueled by the data framework, resultant base data stream, and rigorous feature creation process put forward in IDEFA-integrating iterative design, feature engineering, and analysis for optimal insight into serious play."
Education as a domain of natural data extraction: analysing corporate discourse about educational tracking,Big data; datafication; data collection; surveillance; dataveillance,BIG DATA; MEDIA REPRESENTATION; SURVEILLANCE; DATAVEILLANCE; INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY; METAPHORS; SCHOOLS,"Digital platforms and learning analytics are becoming increasingly widespread in the education sector: commercial corporations argue their benefits for teaching and learning, thereby endorsing the continuous automated collection and processing of student data for measurement, assessment, management, and identity formation. Largely missing in these discourses, however, are the potential costs of datafication for pupils' and teachers' agency and the meaning of education itself. This article explores the general discursive framing by which these surveillant practices in education have come to seem natural. Through a study of commercial suppliers of educational platforms, we show how the prevailing vision of datafication in their discourses categorises software systems, not teachers, as central to education, reimagining space, time, and agency within educational processes around the organisation of data systems and the demands of commercial data production. Not only does this legitimate the new connective environment of dataveillance (that is, surveillance through data processing), but it also naturalises a widernormativeenvironment in which teachers and students are assigned new roles and responsibilities. In the process, the panoptic possibilities of ubiquitous commercial access to personal educational data are presented as part of a virtuous circle of knowledge production and even training for good citizenship. This broader rethinking of educationthroughsurveillance must itself be critiqued."
Performance-based evaluation of academic libraries in the big data era,Academic libraries; big data analytics; evaluation; librarians; performance; skills,DATA ANALYTICS; FIRM PERFORMANCE; LEARNING ANALYTICS; DIGITAL LIBRARY; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; CHALLENGES; EDUCATION; IMPACT; IMPLEMENTATION,"The concept of big data has been extensively considered as a technological modernisation in organisations and educational institutes. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine whether the modified technology acceptance model (MTAM) is viable for evaluating the performance of librarians in the use of big data analytics in academic libraries. This study used an empirical research method for collecting data from 211 librarians working in Pakistan's universities. On the basis of the findings of the MTAM analysis by structural equation modelling, the performances of the academic libraries were comprehended through the process of big data. The main influential components of the performance analysis in this study were the big data analytics capabilities, perceived ease of access and the usefulness of big data practices in academic libraries. Subsequently, the utilisation of big data was significantly affected by skills, perceived ease of access and the usefulness of academic libraries. The results also suggested that the various components of the academic libraries lead to effective organisational performance when linked to big data analytics."
Multimodal Data Value Chain (M-DVC): A Conceptual Tool to Support the Development of Multimodal Learning Analytics Solutions,Data Value Chain; Multimodal Learning Analytics; Usefulness; Evaluation; Stakeholder communication; Conceptual tools,,"Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) systems, understood as those that exploit multimodal evidence of learning to better model a learning situation, have not yet spread widely in educational practice. Their inherent technical complexity, and the lack of educational stakeholder involvement in their design, are among the hypothesized reasons for the slow uptake of this emergent field. To aid in the process of stakeholder communication and systematization leading to the specification of MMLA systems, this paper proposes a Multimodal Data Value Chain (M-DVC). This conceptual tool, derived from both the field of Big Data and the needs of MMLA scenarios, has been evaluated in terms of its usefulness for stakeholders, in three authentic case studies of MMLA systems currently under development. The results of our mixed-methods evaluation highlight the usefulness of the M-DVC to elicit unspoken assumptions or unclear data processing steps in the initial stages of development. The evaluation also revealed limitations of the M-DVC in terms of the technical terminology employed, and the need for more detailed contextual information to be included. These limitations also prompt potential improvements for the M-DVC, on the path towards clearer specification and communication within the multi-disciplinary teams needed to build educationally-meaningful MMLA solutions."
"Prerequisites for artificial intelligence in further education: identification of drivers, barriers, and business models of educational technology companies",Learning analytics; Algorithms-based learning; Artificial intelligence; Further education; Higher education; Business models; Educational technology,LEARNING ANALYTICS; BIG DATA; BENEFITS; FUTURE,"The ongoing datafication of our social reality has resulted in the emergence of new data-based business models. This development is also reflected in the education market. An increasing number of educational technology (EdTech) companies are entering the traditional education market with data-based teaching and learning solutions, and they are permanently transforming the market. However, despite the current market dynamics, there are hardly any business models that implement the possibilities of Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create adaptive teaching and learning paths. This paper focuses on EdTech companies and the drivers and barriers that currently affect data-based teaching and learning paths. The results show that LA especially are integrated into the current business models of EdTech companies on three levels, which are as follows: basic Learning Analytics, Learning Analytics and algorithmic or human-based recommendations, and Learning Analytics and adaptive teaching and learning (AI based). The discourse analysis reveals a diametrical relationship between the traditional educational ideal and the futuristic idea of education and knowledge transfer. While the desire for flexibility and individualization drives the debate on AI-based learning systems, a lack of data sovereignty, uncertainty and a lack of understanding of data are holding back the development and implementation of appropriate solutions at the same time."
Advancing Agricultural Production With Machine Learning Analytics: Yield Determinants for California's Almond Orchards,Prunus dulcis; yield gap; artificial intelligence; big data; light interceptioon; nutrient management,TEMPERATURE; CROPS; PRECIPITATION; TREE,"Agricultural productivity is subject to various stressors, including abiotic and biotic threats, many of which are exacerbated by a changing climate, thereby affecting long-term sustainability. The productivity of tree crops such as almond orchards, is particularly complex. To understand and mitigate these threats requires a collection of multi-layer large data sets, and advanced analytics is also critical to integrate these highly heterogeneous datasets to generate insights about the key constraints on the yields at tree and field scales. Here we used a machine learning approach to investigate the determinants of almond yield variation in California's almond orchards, based on a unique 10-year dataset of field measurements of light interception and almond yield along with meteorological data. We found that overall the maximum almond yield was highly dependent on light interception, e.g., with each one percent increase in light interception resulting in an increase of 57.9 lbs/acre in the potential yield. Light interception was highest for mature sites with higher long term mean spring incoming solar radiation (SRAD), and lowest for younger orchards when March maximum temperature was lower than 19 degrees C. However, at any given level of light interception, actual yield often falls significantly below full yield potential, driven mostly by tree age, temperature profiles in June and winter, summer mean daily maximum vapor pressure deficit (VPDmax), and SRAD. Utilizing a full random forest model, 82% (+/- 1%) of yield variation could be explained when using a sixfold cross validation, with a RMSE of 480 +/- 9 lbs/acre. When excluding light interception from the predictors, overall orchard characteristics (such as age, location, and tree density) and inclusive meteorological variables could still explain 78% of yield variation. The model analysis also showed that warmer winter conditions often limited mature orchards from reaching maximum yield potential and summer VPDmax beyond 40 hPa significantly limited the yield. Our findings through the machine learning approach improved our understanding of the complex interaction between climate, canopy light interception, and almond nut production, and demonstrated a relatively robust predictability of almond yield. This will ultimately benefit data-driven climate adaptation and orchard nutrient management approaches."
Predicting academic performance of students from VLE big data using deep learning models,Learning analytics; Predicting success; Educational data; Machine learning; Deep learning; Virtual learning environments (VLE),HIGHER-EDUCATION; ANALYTICS; ENGAGEMENT; RETENTION; MOBILE,"The abundance of accessible educational data, supported by the technology-enhanced learning platforms, provides opportunities to mine learning behavior of students, addressing their issues, optimizing the educational environment, and enabling data-driven decision making. Virtual learning environments complement the learning analytics paradigm by effectively providing datasets for analysing and reporting the learning process of students and its reflection and contribution in their respective performances. This study deploys a deep artificial neural network on a set of unique handcrafted features, extracted from the virtual learning environments clickstream data, to predict at-risk students providing measures for early intervention of such cases. The results show the proposed model to achieve a classification accuracy of 84%-93%. We show that a deep artificial neural network outperforms the baseline logistic regression and support vector machine models. While logistic regression achieves an accuracy of 79.82%-85.60%, the support vector machine achieves 79.95%-89.14%. Aligned with the existing studies - our findings demonstrate the inclusion of legacy data and assessment-related data to impact the model significantly. Students interested in accessing the content of the previous lectures are observed to demonstrate better performance. The study intends to assist institutes in formulating a necessary framework for pedagogical support, facilitating higher education decision-making process towards sustainable education."
State of Art of Data Mining and Learning Analytics Tools in Higher Education,Learning Analytics; LMS; Big Data; Educational Data Mining; Text Mining; Modeling,BIG DATA; ONLINE; ORANGE,"In this decade, the use of learning management systems (LMS) does not cease to increase, becoming one of the most popular approaches adopted and widely used in the learning process. Learners' online activities generate a huge amount of unused data that is wasted because traditional learning analyses are not able to process them. In this regard, a large collection of applications/tools have emerged to conduct research in educational data mining (EDM) and / or learning analysis (LA). This study looks into the recent applications/tools of Big Data technologies in education and presents some of the most widely used, accessible, and powerful tools in this field of research. The majority of these tools are for researchers with the purpose of conducting research on educational data mining and learning analysis."
Teachers' perceptions of data management as educational resource,Big data; educational big data; learning analytics; comparative case study; Chinese education; Norwegian education,DIGITAL DATA,"Introduction of data-driven tools and practices in education may improve learning but also change education in ways not yet fully understood. Globally, ministries are now beginning to define big data policies for schools. How will this influence the work of teachers, and how do they want to engage with the new sources of information? This study compares two cases from Norway and China, two countries with very different educational systems and cultures, and different implementation policies. In a survey, a hundred primary and secondary school teachers from each country were asked what they wanted to know about their students, and what data they wanted educational big data analysis to be based upon. Qualitative analysis of learning technology infrastructure projects in Tongzhou district in Beijing and in Oslo and national policies provided a backdrop for interpreting the teachers' answers. Focus group interviews with teachers gave additional insights into the different approaches to educational big data. This study shows that Chinese teachers have a much more open mind and interest for all information data may provide, while Norwegian teachers are more focussed on knowledge acquisition and would like to limit the scope to learning and teaching the curriculum, being concerned about questions related to privacy and data surveillance. Some of these differences could be explained by the differences in context of introducing big data in schools. In China, economic innovation is the driver, while in Norway the pretext for the introduction of learning analytics is adapted education. This study contributes to the knowledge of how data policies will impact on design of learning analytics tools and solutions. Approaches and technologies in this field have a global scope. Therefore, understanding how personal digital data is perceived in different cultural contexts is vital for both development and implementation."
Utilizing Student Time Series Behaviour in Learning Management Systems for Early Prediction of Course Performance,Learning analytics; predictive analytics; learning management system; long short-term memory network; LSTM; machine learning,HIGHER-EDUCATION; MODELS; LSTM,"Predictive analytics in higher education has become increasingly popular in recent years with the growing availability of educational big data. Particularly, a wealth of student activity data is available from learning management systems (LMSs) in most academic institutions. However, previous investigations into predictive analytics in higher education using LMS activity data did not adequatelyaccommodate student behaviours in the form of time series. In this study, we have applied a deep learning approach - long short-term memory (LSTM) networks - to analyze student online temporal behaviours using their LMS data for the early prediction of course performance. To reveal the potential of the deep learning approach in predictive analytics, we compared LSTM networks with eight conventional machine-learning classifiers in terms of the prediction performance as measured by the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) scores. Results indicate that using the deep learning approach, time series information about click frequencies successfully provided early detection of at-risk students with moderate prediction accuracy. In addition, the deep learning approach showed higher prediction performance and stronger generalizability than the machine learning classifiers."

SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE IN EDUCATION: BIG DATA PERSPECTIVE,Big data; social media; education; Facebook; Twitter,LEARNING ANALYTICS,"It is undeniable that social media is one of the most important tools introduced to society as it is used intensively in everyday dialogues. The most popular social media channels are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc. They are helpful tools for people, especially when it comes to communication, and they are also very beneficial for exchanging or sharing opinions, knowledge and experience. In recent years, the use of social media has spread to many fields, both formal and informal, in order to achieve certain goals. The field of education is one of the most common formal areas that uses social media as an educational tool for guiding students, motivating them, and providing them both lectures notes and feedback. However, the continuous use of educational methods based on social media has led to an increase in the amount of data. In the literature, it is defined as Big Data. This leads to significant difficulties in analysing and using this data to enhance educational performance, its effectiveness, and supporting primary researches that are related to education, which are difficult and sometimes impossible to perform manually. For these reasons, Big Data Analytic Techniques must be used to achieve this goal. The main aim of this literature review paper is to provide information about Big Data along with its advantages and challenges. Also, Big Data Analytic Techniques will be explained and their usage in education will be discussed. We hope that this paper will help educational institutions to select suitable/effective Big Data Analytic Techniques for their needs and to analyse their Big Data to help students."
CONSOLIDATING THE DIGITAL EDUCATIONAL TRANSFORMATION IN ANDALUSIA,New projects and innovations; APP for education; Identity Management; Learning Analytics; Open Educational Resources; LOR; Digital Education; Collaboration,,"This paper presents the project for the implementation of the Virtual Learning Environment for non university education in Andalusia, a Spanish region with more than 8 million inhabitants, which educational community consists of over 2 million people (teachers, students and families), in a very heterogeneous scenario, encompassing geography, socio-economy and technology. The project is led by the General Directorate for Teacher Training and Educational Innovation (DGFPIE) of the Ministry of Education and Sports (CED), and its main objective is the consolidation of the Digital Educational Transformation in Andalusia (TDE), focusing on the optimisation of services to grant the best use of the resources. The project' strategy is fully aligned with the EU's Digital Education Action Plan, upon a global, collaborative and inclusive approach, making emphasis in granting universal access to resources and services to all the groups of the Educational Community. Once high connectivity is provided to schools, the project is defined around three action lines that consolidate the TDE ecosystem of the DGFPIE: Improving the use of digital technology in teaching-learning processes Developing digital competencies and skills relevant to the educational community Promoting the improvement of school results and reduction of dropout through Big Data (BD), Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The project methodologies cover technological, implementation and dissemination aspects, and consist of adaptations of gap analysis, design thinking, Lean IT, BPM and TOGAF for the definition phase, scrum for the development and ITIL, PMP and OPPM services provision and project management. Regarding implementation and dissemination, any new service provided is tested in a piloting phase prior to its go alive, with a defined piloting methodology. The result, the Andalusian Digital Education Ecosystem is a personalized teaching-learning environment that provides access to a digital classroom, integrated with the backoffice management system, which allows class organization and planning, connected with the digital content of publishers and with an open educational resources banks (LOR). This pedagogical support is complemented with services to promote the digital training of students, families and teachers through a MOOC, MoocEdu, fully aligned with the DigCompX frameworks. A Digital Proficiency Test is included to diagnose the user skills and stablish a starting point, recommending training actions to achieve the defined objectives. Through this single access point, schools benefit from facilities to collaborate which include a vast community of school blogs and classroom spaces, BlogsAverroes, ever growing to support communication needs for different decision-making bodies within the CED. AI allows the provision of a Pedagogical Assessment Service, a personalized and contextualized educational reinforcement of the students through recommendations of itineraries, contents, tasks and/or readings adapted to their academic situation, which take into account information related to the characteristics of their teachers, their socioeconomic context and their academic performance, among others. The project results are measured by means of access and use indicators, which together with the user's satisfaction, checked by the change management service, establish the conclusions and the basis for the continuous improvement of the TDE ecosystem."
Automated Insightful Drill-Down Recommendations for Learning Analytics Dashboards,learning analytics dashboards; decision trees; drill-down analysis; exploratory data analysis,,"The big data revolution is an exciting opportunity for universities, which typically have rich and complex digital data on their learners. It has motivated many universities around the world to invest in the development and implementation of learning analytics dashboards (LADs). These dashboards commonly make use of interactive visualisation widgets to assist educators in understanding and making informed decisions about the learning process. A common operation in analytical dashboards is a 'drill-down', which in an educational setting allows users to explore the behaviour of sub-populations of learners by progressively adding filters. Nevertheless, drill-down challenges exist, which hamper the most effective use of the data, especially by users without a formal background in data analysis. Accordingly, in this paper, we address this problem by proposing an approach that recommends insightful drill-downs to LAD users. We present results from an application of our proposed approach using an existing LAD. A set of insightful drill-down criteria from a course with 875 students are explored and discussed."
Predicting students' academic performance: Levy search of cuckoo-based hybrid classification,data mining; educational data mining; map reduce framework; support vector machine; deep belief network; cuckoo search algorithm; Levy flight,MODEL; PERCEPTIONS; ADOPTION,"Educational Data Mining (EDM) exists as a novel trend in the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and Data Mining (DM) field that concerns in mining valuable patterns and finding out practical knowledge from the educational systems. However, evaluating the educational performance of students is challenging as their academic performance pivots on varied constraints. Hence, this paper intends to predict the educational performance of students based on socio-demographic information. To attain this, performance prediction architecture is introduced with two modules. One module is for handling the big data via MapReduce (MR) framework, whereas the second module is an intelligent module that predicts the performance of the students using intelligent data processing stages. Here, the hybridisation of classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Belief Network (DBN) is adopted to get better results. In DBN, Levy Search of Cuckoo (LC) algorithm is adopted for weight computation. Hence, the proposed prediction model SVM-LCDBN is proposed that makes deep connection with the hybrid classifier to attain more accurate output. Moreover, the adopted scheme is compared with conventional algorithms, and the results are attained."

Big data have started to demonstrate significant values in higher education. This paper gives several contributions to the state-of-the-art for Big data in higher education and learning technologies research. Currently, there is no comprehensive survey or literature review for Big educational data. Most literature reviews from a few authors have focused on one of these fields: educational mining, learning analytics with discussions on one or two aspects such as Big data technologies without educational focus, social media data in education, etc. Most of these literature reviews are short and insufficient to provide more inclusive reviews for Big educational data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature review of the current and emerging paradigms for Big educational data. The survey is presented in five parts: (1) The first part presents an overview and classification of Big education research to show the full landscape in this field, which also gives a concise summary of the overall scope of this paper; (2) The second part presents a discussion for the various data sources from education platforms or systems including learning management systems (LMS), massive open online courses (MOOC), learning object repository (LOR), OpenCourseWare (OCW), open educational resources (OER), social media, linked data and mobile learning contributing to Big education data; (3) The third part presents the data collection, data mining and databases in Big education data; (4) The fourth part presents the technological aspects including Big data platforms and architectures such as Hadoop, Spark, Samza and Big data tools for Big education data; and (5) The fifth part presents different approaches of data analytics for Big education data. This part provides a more inclusive discussion on data analytics which is beyond traditional forms of learning analysis in higher education. This includes predictive analytics, learning analytics including collaborative, behavior, personal learnings and assessment, followed by recommendation systems, graph analytics, visual analytics, immersive learning and analytics, etc. The final part of the paper discusses social (e.g. privacy and ethical issues) and technological challenges for Big data in education. This part also illustrates the technological challenges faced by giving an example for utilizing graph-based analytics for a cross-institution learning analytics scenario."
We called that a behavior: The making of institutional data,Big Data; institutions; predictive modeling; nudge; higher education; student data,BIG DATA; LEARNING ANALYTICS; SURVEILLANCE; ETHNOGRAPHY; PRIVACY; ETHICS,"Predictive uses of data are becoming widespread in institutional settings as actors seek to anticipate people and their activities. Predictive modeling is increasingly the subject of scholarly and public criticism. Less common, however, is scrutiny directed at the data that inform predictive models beyond concerns about homogenous training data or general epistemological critiques of data. In this paper, I draw from a qualitative case study set in higher education in the United States to investigate the making of data. Data analytics projects at universities have become more pervasive and intensive to better understand and anticipate undergraduate student bodies. Drawing from 12 months of ethnographic research at a large public university, I analyze the ways data personnel at the institution-data scientists, administrators, and programmers-sort student data into attributes and behaviors, where attributes are demographic data that students can't change. Behaviors, in contrast, are data defined as reflective of what students can choose: attending and paying attention in class, studying on campus, among other data which personnel categorize as what students have control over. This discursive split enables the institution nudge students to make responsible choices according to behavior data that correlate with success in the predictive model. In discussing how personnel type, sort, stabilize, and nudge on behavior data, this paper examines the contingencies of data making processes and implications for the application of student data."
Effective usage of learning analytics: what do practitioners want and where should distance learning institutions be going?,learning analytics; distance education; case-study; professional development,BIG DATA; DESIGN; SATISFACTION; EDUCATION; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE,"The implementation of learning analytics may empower distance learning institutions to provide real-time feedback to students and teachers. Given the leading role of the Open University UK (OU) in research and application of learning analytics, this study aims to share the lessons learned from the experiences of 42 participants from a range of faculty, academic and professional positions, and expertise with learning analytics. Furthermore, we explored where distance learning institutions should be going next in terms of learning analytics adoption. The findings from the Learning Analytics User Stories (LAUS) workshop indicated four key areas where more work is needed: communication, personalisation, integrated design, and development of an evidence-base. The workshop outputs signalled the aspiration for an integrated analytics system transcending the entire student experience, from initial student inquiry right through to qualification completion and into life-long learning. We hope that our study will spark discussion on whether (or not) distance learning institutions should pursue the dream of an integrated, personalised, and evidence-based learning analytics system that clearly communicates useful feedback to staff and students, or whether this will become an Orwellian nightmare."
An overview and comparison of supervised data mining techniques for student exam performance prediction,Adult learning; Evaluation methodologies; Intelligent tutoring systems; Programming and programming languages,LEARNING ANALYTICS; BIG DATA; ENGAGEMENT; ATTITUDES; BENEFITS; IMPACT,"Recent increase in the availability of learning data has given educational data mining an importance and momentum, in order to better understand and optimize the learning process and environments in which it occurs. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis and comparison of state of the art supervised machine learning techniques applied for solving the task of student exam performance prediction, i.e. discovering students at a high risk of dropping out from the course, and predicting their future achievements, such as for instance, the final exam scores. For both classification and regression tasks, the overall highest precision was obtained with artificial neural networks by feeding the student engagement data and past performance data, while the usage of demographic data did not show significant influence on the precision of predictions. To exploit the full potential of the student exam performance prediction, it was concluded that adequate data acquisition functionalities and the student interaction with the learning environment is a prerequisite to ensure sufficient amount of data for analysis."
A predictive analytics framework as a countermeasure for attrition of students,Educational data mining; big data; machine learning; distance learning; learning analytics,,"Attrition is one of the main concerns in distance learning due to the impact on the incomes and institutions reputation. Timely identification of students at risk has high practical value in effective students' retention services. Big Data mining and machine learning methods are applied to manipulate, analyze, and predict students' failure, supporting self-directed learning. Despite the extensive application of data mining to education, the imbalance problem in minority classes of students' attrition is often overlooked in conventional models. This document proposes a large data frame using the Hadoop ecosystem and the application of machine learning techniques to different datasets of an academic year at the Hellenic Open University. Datasets were divided into 35 weeks; 32 classifiers were created, compared and statistically analyzed to address the minority classes' imbalance of student's failure. The algorithms MetaCost-SMO and C4.5 provide the most accurate performance for each target class. Early predictions of timeframes determine a remarkable performance, while the importance of written assignments and specific quizzes is noticeable. The models' performance in any week is exploited by developing a prediction tool for student attrition, contributing to timely and personalized intervention."
A Pedagogical Perspective on Big Data and Learning Analytics: A Conceptual Model for Digital Learning Support,Learning analytics; Social learning analytics; Digital learning support; Learning analytics taxonomy,FRAMEWORK; EDUCATION; FEEDBACK; SENSE,"The increasing prevalence of learner-centred forms of learning as well as an increase in the number of learners actively participating on a wide range of digital platforms and devices give rise to an ever-increasing stream of learning data. Learning analytics (LA) can enable learners, teachers, and their institutions to better understand and predict learning and performance. However, the pedagogical perspective and matters of learning design have been underrepresented in research thus far. In our paper, we propose a general design framework that includes critical dimensions of LA and assists in creating LA services that support educational practice. On the basis of a two-dimensional framework (individual vs. social, reflection vs. prediction), we then identify four generic approaches to LA aimed at improving learning process and learning outcomes. To demonstrate the application, four use cases are outlined that are based on four previously elaborated generic approaches to LA. Finally, we discuss the validation of the model and close with an outlook on relevant future research."
The Role of Active Engagement of Peer Observation in the Acquisition of Surgical Skills in Virtual Reality Tasks for Novices,collaborative learning; peer-assisted learning; observational learning; virtual reality; surgical simulation; robotic surgery,BIG DATA; SIMULATION; ANALYTICS; VR,"OBJECTIVE: Peer-assisted learning has been regarded as an adjunct to teaching modalities. It remains inconclusive regarding the benefits of peer observation in skills learning. Hence, we investigated whether the active engagement (AE) of peer observation in addition to expert demonstration would facilitate the performance in the virtual reality (VR) tasks. SETTING/DESIGN: The programs involved 4 VR tasks including basic (camera targeting), intermediate (energy dissection and energy switching), and advanced (suture sponge) tasks in the da Vinci Skills Simulators, which were set up in the operating room at Taipei Medical University Hospital. Fifty medical students participated in the study. The AE of the participants was defined as the total number of peer observations in addition to expert observation before their performance. We assessed the correlations between AE and surgical task performance using Pearson correlation and the concept of learning analytics. PARTICIPANTS: Medical students (sixth-year students in Taiwan, equivalent to fourth-year students in the US system) from Taipei Medical University were recruited. RESULTS: AE was correlated with the energy dissection task (r = 0.329, p = 0.02) and marginally associated with the energy switching task (r = 0.271, p = 0.057). However, AE was not correlated with either task scores for camera targeting (r = 0.096, p = 0.509) or task scores for suture sponge (r = 0.091, p = 0.529). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that AE of peer observation may facilitate learning energy dissection task, which is an intermediate-level task, but not in other basic or advanced tasks in a VR context. The study highlights the potential effect of AE of peer observation on surgical learning based on a distinct level of tasks. Tasks that fit the learners' level are recommended. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of peer observation on surgical training still has to be explored to ensure favorable results and optimal learning outcomes.

One of the most common courses offered by higher academic institutions in the US is data science. This paper examines the data science syllabi found in today's academic sector and compares the results to those of Friedman's, Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 26(5), 135-148 (2017) study of Big Data syllabi. For the present study, 40 data science syllabi used in private and public academic institutions in the US were collected, and Palmer et al.'s, To Improve the Academy, 33, 14-36 (2014) rubric was used as a framework to analyze them. The study found that the most frequently used communication engagement tool, according to the syllabi, was discussion forums (used in 53% of the syllabi), and instant message applications were second (21%). Using Palmer et al.'s rubric, the study found 95% of all data science syllabi the study examined provided very detailed articulation and scored in the top range outline by the model. In comparing data science syllabi to big data syllabi, the study found that data science syllabi provided better descriptions of the learning goals than did big data syllabi. Future studies could examine students' participation and appreciation of these courses using a machine analytics rubric."
Grade prediction of weekly assignments in MOOCS: mining video-viewing behavior,MOOCs; Prediction Analysis; Explanation Analysis; Machine Learning; Educational Data Mining; Course Performance; Course Grades,CLASSROOM,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) hold the promise of democratizing the learning process. However, providing effective feedback has proven hard to offer at scale since most methods require a teacher or tutor. Leveraging big data in MOOCs offers a mechanism to develop predictive models that can inform computer-based pedagogical tutors. We review research on grade prediction and examine the predictive power of a model based on user video-watching behavior. In a MOOC organized around weekly assignments, we find that frequency of video viewing per week is a better predictor than individual viewing features such as plays, pauses, seeking, and rate changes. This finding is useful for MOOCs that use assignments for course evaluations in addition or to the exclusion of in-video quizzes for formative assessment. Engaging, well-crafted assignments in MOOCs have the potential of boosting student retention and course completion by fostering a deeper understanding through application and practice."

Learning Analytics or Educational Data Mining? This is the Question ...,EDM; LA; Data Mining; Education,,"In full expansion, a vital area such as education could not remain indifferent to the use of information and communication technology. Over the past two decades we have witnessed the emergence and development of e-learning systems, the proliferation of MOOCs, and generally the rise of Technology Enhanced Education. All of these contributed to generation and storage of unprecedented volumes of data concerning all areas of learning. At the same time, domains such as data mining and big data analytics have emerged and developed. Their applications in education have spawned new areas of research such as educational data mining or learning analytics. As an interdisciplinary research area Educational Data Mining (EDM) aims to explore data from educational environment to build models based on which students' behavior and results are better understood. In fact, EDM is a complex process that consists of a few steps grouped in three stages: data preprocessing, modelling and postprocessing. It transforms raw data from educational environments in useful information that could influence in a positive way the educational process. According to Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) which took over the wording of the first International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, learning analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs (Siemens, 2011). This paper proposes a comparative study of the two concepts: EDM and learning analytics. Due to certain voices in the scientific environment that claim that the two terms refer to the same thing, we want to emphasize the similarities and differences between them, and how each one can serve to raise the quality in educational processes."

Using privacy concepts from the literature and emergent themes, the authors analyzed the corpus. Findings Most syllabi did not mention privacy (98 percent). Privacy tended to be mentioned in the context of digital tools, course communication, policies and assignments. Originality/value In an age of educational data mining and analytics, this is one of the first studies to consider if and how instructors are addressing student data privacy in their courses, and the study initiates an important conversation for reflecting on privacy values and practices."

DATA-DRIVEN MODELING OF ENGAGEMENT ANALYTICS FOR QUALITY BLENDED LEARNING,Engagement analytics; data-driven modeling; quality teaching and learning,,"Engagement analytics is a branch of learning analytics (LA) that focuses on student engagement, with most studies conducted by computer scientists. Thus, rather than focusing on learning, research in this field usually treats education as a scenario for algorithms optimization and it rarely concludes with implications for practice. While LA as a research field is reaching ten years, its contribution to our understanding of teaching and learning and its impact on learning enhancement are still underdeveloped. This paper argues that data-driven modeling of engagement analytics is helpful to assess student engagement and to promote reflections on the quality of teaching and learning. In this article, the authors a) introduce four key constructs (student engagement, learning analytics, engagement analytics, modeling and data-driven modeling); b) explain why data-driven modeling is chosen for engagement analytics and the limitations of using a predefined framework; c) discuss how to use engagement analytics to promote pedagogical reflection using a pilot study as a demonstration. As a final remark, the authors see the need of interdisciplinary collaboration on engagement analytics between computer science and educational science. In fact, this collaboration should enhance the use of machine learning and data mining methods to explore big data in education to provide effective insights for quality educational practice."
Privacy engineering for learning analytics in a global market Defining a point of reference,Cross-cultural studies; Learning analytics; Educational Big Data; Privacy engineering; Information privacy,INFORMATION PRIVACY; BIG DATA; CONTEXT; CHINA,"Purpose Privacy is a culturally universal process; however, in the era of Big Data privacy is handled very differently in different parts of the world. This is a challenge when designing tools and approaches for the use of Educational Big Data (EBD) and learning analytics (LA) in a global market. The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of information privacy in a cross-cultural setting to define a common point of reference for privacy engineering. Design/methodology/approach The paper follows a conceptual exploration approach. Conceptual work on privacy in EBD and LA in China and the west is contrasted with the general discussion of privacy in a large corpus of literature and recent research. As much of the discourse on privacy has an American or European bias, intimate knowledge of Chinese education is used to test the concept of privacy and to drive the exploration of how information privacy is perceived in different cultural and educational settings. Findings The findings indicate that there are problems using privacy concepts found in European and North-American theories to inform privacy engineering for a cross-cultural market in the era of Big Data. Theories based on individualism and ideas of control of private information do not capture current global digital practice. The paper discusses how a contextual and culture-aware understanding of privacy could be developed to inform privacy engineering without letting go of universally shared values. The paper concludes with questions that need further research to fully understand information privacy in education. Originality/value As far as the authors know, this paper is the first attempt to discuss - from a comparative and cross-cultural perspective - information privacy in an educational context in the era of Big Data. The paper presents initial explorations of a problem that needs urgent attention if good intentions of privacy supportive educational technologies are to be turned into more than political slogans."
Mining big data to help make informed decisions for designing effective digital educational games,Educational big data; learning analytics; digital games; middle school science; behavioral patterns,LEARNING ANALYTICS; BEHAVIORS; PATTERNS,"More research is needed on how to best use analytics to support educational decisions and design effective learning environments. This study was to explore and mine the data captured by a digital educational game designed for middle school science to understand learners' behavioral patterns in using the game, and to use evidence-based findings to inform the design and implementation of the game's next iteration. The data was from 3,963 sixth-grade students from 31 teachers across nine U.S. states who used the game. The dataset consisted of 3,063,267 lines of log data. The findings showed significant positive relationships between students' performance scores and their tool usage in terms of both frequency and duration of tool use. This was further confirmed by the relationships between different levels of students' performance and tool usage: the more frequently and longer that students used the tools, the higher their performance scores, and there were significant differences between students with high performance scores and those with low performance scores. Comparing three different cases over the individual days of game use provided further evidence that in all three comparisons, the students who used more essential tools and for longer time had higher performance scores. Implications are discussed."
GAN-based pencil drawing learning system for art education on large-scale image datasets with learning analytics,Pencil drawing learning system; GAN; art education; pencil drawing big data; learning analytic,TEACHING ASSISTANT; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; AUGMENTED REALITY; VISUALIZATION; SURGERY; ROBOT,"We design a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based pencil drawing learning system for art education on large image datasets to help students study how to draw pencil drawings for images and scenes. The system generates a pencil drawing result for a natural image based on GAN. The GAN network is trained on pencil drawing big datasets containing image pairs of natural images and their corresponding pencil drawings. Using the pencil drawing learning system, students can paint pencil drawings whenever they want and for whatever they like by uploading an image of the content they want to draw and getting a pencil drawing example of the uploaded image from the system. With the returned pencil drawing, students will see the pencil drawing effect of natural scenes clearly and realize how to draw the pencil drawing for the natural scene. Besides, with students using the pencil drawing learning system, it will be convenient for teachers assigning homework to students. Teachers can know the learning demands of students by evaluating the hand-in homework and update the content correspondingly. We have conducted two user studies for evaluating the practicality of the system, and the result of the two user studies demonstrated the applicability and practicality of the system."
Predicting students' academic performance by using educational big data and learning analytics: evaluation of classification methods and learning logs,Educational big data; learning analytics; classification methods; learning logs; academic performance,ONLINE; PARTICIPATION,"In order to enhance the experience of learning, many educators applied learning analytics in a classroom, the major principle of learning analytics is targeting at-risk student and given timely intervention according to the results of student behavior analysis. However, when researchers applied machine learning to train a risk identifying model, the reason which affected the performance of the model was overlooked. This study collected seven datasets within three universities located in Taiwan and Japan and listed performance metrics of risk identification model after fed data into eight classification methods. U1, U2, and U3 were used to denote the three universities, which have three, two, and two cases of datasets (learning logs), respectively. According to the results of this study, the factors influencing the predictive performance of classification methods are the number of significant features, the number of categories of significant features, and Spearman correlation coefficient values. In U1 dataset case 1.3 and U2 dataset case 2.2, the numbers of significant features, numbers of categories of significant features, and Spearman correlation coefficient values for significant features were all relatively high, which is the main reason why these datasets were able to perform classification with high predictive ability."
Learning analytics and higher education: a proposed model for establishing informed consent mechanisms to promote student privacy and autonomy,Higher education; Learning analytics; Student privacy; Autonomy; Informed consent,PRINCIPLES,"By tracking, aggregating, and analyzing student profiles along with students' digital and analog behaviors captured in information systems, universities are beginning to open the black box of education using learning analytics technologies. However, the increase in and usage of sensitive and personal student data present unique privacy concerns. I argue that privacy-as-control of personal information is autonomy promoting, and that students should be informed about these information flows and to what ends their institution is using them. Informed consent is one mechanism by which to accomplish these goals, but Big Data practices challenge the efficacy of this strategy. To ensure the usefulness of informed consent, I argue for the development of Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) technology and assert that privacy dashboards will enable student control and consent mechanisms, while providing an opportunity for institutions to justify their practices according toexisting norms and values."
Machine behaviourism: future visions of 'learnification' and 'datafication' across humans and digital technologies,Behaviourism; behavioural economics; data science; nudging; machine learning; reinforcement learning,LEARNING ANALYTICS; EDUCATION,"This paper examines visions of 'learning' across humans and machines in a near-future of intensive data analytics. Building upon the concept of 'learnification', practices of 'learning' in emerging big data-driven environments are discussed in two significant ways: the training of machines, and the nudging of human decisions through digital choice architectures. Firstly, 'machine learning' is discussed as an important example of how data-driven technologies are beginning to influence educational activity, both through sophisticated technical expertise and a grounding in behavioural psychology. Secondly, we explore how educational software design informed by behavioural economics is increasingly intended to frame learner choices to influence and 'nudge' decisions towards optimal outcomes. Through the growing influence of 'data science' on education, behaviourist psychology is increasingly and powerfully invested in future educational practices. Finally, it is argued that future education may tend toward very specific forms of behavioural governance - a 'machine behaviourism' - entailing combinations of radical behaviourist theories and machine learning systems, that appear to work against notions of student autonomy and participation, seeking to intervene in educational conduct and shaping learner behaviour towards predefined aims."
Sentiment mining in a collaborative learning environment: capitalising on big data,Big data; sentiment mining; educational data mining; machine learning,NAIVE BAYES; EMOTION; ANALYTICS; MODELS; CLASSIFICATION; CRM,"The ability to exploit students' sentiments using different machine learning techniques is considered an important strategy for planning and manoeuvring in a collaborative educational environment. The advancement of machine learning technology is energised by the healthy growth of big data technologies. This helps the applications based on Sentiment Mining (SM) using big data to become a common platform for data mining activities. However, very little has been studied on the sentiment application using a huge amount of available educational data. Therefore, this paper has made an attempt to mine the academic data using different efficient machine learning algorithms. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (i) studying the sentiment polarity (positive, negative and neutral) from students' data using machine learning techniques, and (ii) modelling and predicting students' emotions (Amused, Anxiety, Bored, Confused, Enthused, Excited, Frustrated, etc.) using the big data frameworks. The developed SM techniques using big data frameworks can be scaled and made adaptable for source variation, velocity and veracity to maximise value mining for the benefit of students, faculties and other stakeholders."
Conflicting Values: An Exploration of the Tensions between Learning Analytics and Academic Librarianship,,BIG DATA; ETHICS; INFORMATION; EDUCATION; PRIVACY,"The prevailing rhetoric concerning learning analytics is that its use will support the educational endeavor and make significant improvements to teaching and learning. For academic libraries, learning analytics presents the possibility of using library data to coordinate, integrate, and align with the goals of the institutions in which they are embedded. While libraries have a long history of collecting data to support various service and learning objectives, those data have typically been siloed, de-identified, private, and confidential. Although there are positive contributions that learning analytics can make to the learning process, there are concerns associated with its use, particularly the tensions between the objectives of learning analytics contrasted with different conceptualizations of learners and the values of education and librarianship. Institutions of higher education use learning analytics to achieve institutionally defined goals and outcomes for students, which creates tensions with the enshrined values of the American Library Association's Code of Ethics, Library Bill of Rights, and Core Competencies of Librarianship. The transcendent benefits to society that are inherent in education and academic librarianship, such as the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, are not measurable through learning analytics."
The Pursuit of Patterns in Educational Data Mining as a Threat to Student Privacy,privacy; learning analytics; distance learning; data publishing; anonymization; statistical disclosure control,,"Recent technological advances have led to tremendous capacities for collecting, storing and analyzing data being created at an ever-increasing speed from diverse sources. Academic institutions which offer open and distance learning programs, such as the Hellenic Open University, can benefit from big data relating to its students' information and communication systems and the use of modern techniques and tools of big data analytics provided that the student's right to privacy is not compromised. The balance between data mining and maintaining privacy can be reached through anonymisation methods but on the other hand this approach raises technical problems such as the loss of a certain amount of information found in the original data. Considering the learning process as a framework of interacting roles and factors, the discovery of patterns in that system can be really useful and beneficial firstly for the learners and furthermore, the ability to publish and share these results would be very helpful for the whole academic institution."
Efficient computation of key performance indicators in a distance learning university,Key performance indicators; E-Learning; Virtual learning environment; Learning analytics; MapReduce; Educational big data,,"Purpose Managing efficiently educational Big Data, produced by Virtual Learning Environments, is becoming a compelling necessity, especially for those universities providing distance learning. This paper aims to propose a possible framework to compute efficiently key performance indicators, summarizing the trends of students' academic careers, by using educational Big Data. Design/methodology/approach The framework is designed and implemented in a distributed fashion. The parallel computation of the indicators through Map and Reduce nodes is carefully described, together with the workflow of data, from the educational sources to a NoSQL database and to the learning analytics engine. Findings This framework was tested at eCampus University, an Italian distance learning institution, and it was able to significantly reduce the amount of time needed to compute key performance indicators. Moreover, by implementing a proper data representation dashboard, it resulted in a useful help and support for educational decisions and performance analyses and for revealing possible criticalities. Originality/value The framework proposed integrates for the first time, to the best of the authors' knowledge, a set of modules, designed and implemented in a distributed fashion, to compute key performance indicators for distance learning institutions. It can be used to analyze the dropouts and the outcomes of students and, therefore, to evaluate the performances of universities, which can, in turn, propose effective improvements toward enhancing the overall e-learning scenario."
Learning analytics techniques and visualisation with textual data for determining causes of academic failure,At risk student; academic failure; text analytics; higher education institution; unstructured data; user-generated content,HIGHER-EDUCATION; BIG DATA; STUDENTS; ADOLESCENTS; ABSENTEEISM; MEXICAN; CHINESE,"The primary goal of higher education institutions is to support all students in the pursuit of academic success, which requires timely assistance for 'at risk' students. The adoption of learning management systems results in a large amount of data that can be collected, processed and utilised to improve the students' learning experiences. This research examines the potential applications of analytics techniques for extracting insights from student-generated content in an academic setting. It showcases how different text analytics techniques, from descriptive content analysis, semantic network analysis, to topic modelling support the discovery of new insights from unstructured, user-generated data. We looked at 968 letters written by 'at risk' students in an Australian-based university in Southeast Asia to examine the difficulties the students faced, which led to their academic failure. The results show that time management, family, learning, assessment, and subjects were the leading causes of poor performance, but in a more nuanced way than was expected. Students often faced multiple challenges, one led to another, which resulted in the failing grades. Our study contributes a set of effective text analytics techniques for extracting insights from student data, providing the preliminary guidelines for an information system to detect early at risk students."
Application of Machine Learning in Predicting Performance for Computer Engineering Students: A Case Study,educational data mining; learning analytics; machine learning; big data; prediction grades,HIGHER-EDUCATION; BIG DATA,"The present work proposes the application of machine learning techniques to predict the final grades (FGs) of students based on their historical performance of grades. The proposal was applied to the historical academic information available for students enrolled in the computer engineering degree at an Ecuadorian university. One of the aims of the university's strategic plan is the development of a quality education that is intimately linked with sustainable development goals (SDGs). The application of technology in teaching-learning processes (Technology-enhanced learning) must become a key element to achieve the objective of academic quality and, as a consequence, enhance or benefit the common good. Today, both virtual and face-to-face educational models promote the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in both teaching-learning processes and academic management processes. This implementation has generated an overload of data that needs to be processed properly in order to transform it into valuable information useful for all those involved in the field of education. Predicting a student's performance from their historical grades is one of the most popular applications of educational data mining and, therefore, it has become a valuable source of information that has been used for different purposes. Nevertheless, several studies related to the prediction of academic grades have been developed exclusively for the benefit of teachers and educational administrators. Little or nothing has been done to show the results of the prediction of the grades to the students. Consequently, there is very little research related to solutions that help students make decisions based on their own historical grades. This paper proposes a methodology in which the process of data collection and pre-processing is initially carried out, and then in a second stage, the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic performance was carried out. In the next phase, based on the identified patterns, the most appropriate supervised learning algorithm was selected, and then the experimental process was carried out. Finally, the results were presented and analyzed. The results showed the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to predict the performance of students."
Clickstream for learning analytics to assess students' behavior with Scratch,Learning analytics; Clickstream; Scratch; Programming; Big data,WEB; PREDICTION,"The construction of knowledge through computational practice requires to teachers a substantial amount of time and effort to evaluate programming skills, to understand and to glimpse the evolution of the students and finally to state a quantitative judgment in learning assessment. The field of learning analytics has been a common practice in research since last years due to their great possibilities in terms of learning improvement. Both, Big and Small data techniques support the analysis cycle of learning analytics and risk of students' failure prediction. Such possibilities can be a strong positive contribution to the field of computational practice such as programming. Our main objective was to help teachers in their assessments through to make those possibilities effective. Thus, we have developed a functional solution to categorize and understand students' behavior in programming activities based in Scratch. Through collection and analysis of data generated by students' clicks in Scratch, we proceed to execute both exploratory and predictive analytics to detect patterns in students' behavior when developing solutions for assignments. We concluded that resultant taxonomy could help teachers to better support their students by giving real-time quality feedback and act before students deliver incorrectly or at least incomplete tasks.

"Understand, develop and enhance the learning process with big data",E-learning; Higher education; Big data; Learning analytics; Learning process; Algorithm,ANALYTICS; INFORMATION,"Purpose With the advent of the internet and communication technology, the penetration of e-learning has increased. The digital data being created by the educational and research institutions is also on the ascent. The growing interest in recent years toward big data, educational data mining and learning analytics has motivated the development of new analytical ways and approaches and advancements in learning settings. The need for using big data to handle, analyze this large amount of data is prime. This trend has started attracting the interest of educational institutions which have an important role in the development skills process and the preparation of a new generation of learners. A real revolution for education, it is based on this kind of terms that many articles have paid attention to big data for learning. How can analytics techniques and tools be so efficient and become a great prospect for the learning process? Big data analytics, when applied into teaching and learning processes, might help to improvise as well as to develop new paradigms. In this perspective, this paper aims to investigate the most promising applications and issues of big data for the design of the next-generation of massive e-learning. Specifically, it addresses the analytical tools and approaches for enhancing the future of e-learning, pitfalls arising from the usage of large data sets. Globally, this paper focuses on the possible application of big data techniques on learning developments, to show the power of analytics and why integrating big data is so important for the learning context. Design/methodology/approach Big data has in the recent years been an area of interest among innovative sectors and has become a major priority for many industries, and learning sector cannot escape to this deluge. This paper focuses on the different methods of big data able to be used in learning context to understand the benefits it can bring both to teaching and learning process, and identify its possible impact on the future of this sector in general. This paper investigates the connection between big data and the learning context. This connection can be illustrated by identifying the several main analytics approaches, methods and tools for improving the learning process. This can be clearer by the examination of the different ways and solutions that contribute to making a learning process more agile and dynamic. The methods that were used in this research are mainly of a descriptive and analytical nature, to establish how big data and analytics methods develop the learning process, and understand their contributions and impacts in addressing learning issues. To this end, authors have collected and reviewed existing literature related to big data in education and the technology application in the learning context. Authors then have done the same process with dynamic and operational examples of big data for learning. In this context, the authors noticed that there are jigsaw bits that contained important knowledge on the different parts of the research area. The process concludes by outlining the role and benefit of the related actors and highlighting the several directions relating to the development and implementation of an efficient learning process based on big data analytics. Findings Big data analytics, its techniques, tools and algorithms are important to improve the learning context. The findings in this paper suggest that the incorporation of an approach based on big data is of crucial importance. This approach can improve the learning process, for this, its implementation must be correctly aligned with educational strategies and learning needs. Research limitations/implications This research represents a reference to better understanding the influence and the role of big data in educational dynamic. In addition, it leads to improve existing literature about big data for learning. The limitations of the paper are given by its nature derived from a theoretical perspective, and the discussed ideas can be empirically validated by identifying how big data helps in addressing learning issues. Originality/value Over the time, the process that leads to the acquisition of the knowledge uses and receives more technological tools and components; this approach has contributed to the development of information communication and the interactive learning context. Technology applications continue to expand the boundaries of education into an anytime/anywhere experience. This technology and its wide use in the learning system produce a vast amount of different kinds of data. These data are still rarely exploited by educational practitioners. Its successful exploitation conducts educational actors to achieve their full potential in a complex and uncertain environment. The general motivation for this research is assisting higher educational institutions to better understand the impact of the big data as a success factor to develop their learning process and achieve their educational strategy and goals. This study contributes to better understand how big data analytics solutions are turned into operational actions and will be particularly valuable to improve learning in educational institutions."
Bridging learning analytics and Cognitive Computing for Big Data classification in micro-learning video collections,Cognitive Computing; Big Data technologies; Micro-learning video; Multi-class classification; Learning Analytics; Video classification,MOOCS,"Moving towards the next generation of personalized learning environments requires intelligent approaches powered by analytics for advanced learning contexts with enriched digital content. Micro-Learning through Massive Open Online Courses is riding the wave of popularity as a novel paradigm for delivering short educational videos in small pre-organized chunks over time, so that learners can get knowledge in a manageable way. However, with the ever-increasing number of videos, it has become challenging to arrange and search them according to specific categories. In this paper, we get around the problem by bridging Learning Analytics and Cognitive Computing to analyze the content of large video collections, going over traditional term-based methods. We propose an efficient and effective approach to automatically classify a collection of educational videos on pre-existing categories which uses (i) a Speech-to-Text tool to get video transcripts, (ii) Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing methods to extract semantic concepts and keywords from video transcripts for their representation, and (iii) Apache Spark as Big Data technology for scalability. Several classifiers are trained on the feature vectors extracted by Cognitive Computing tools. Then, we compared our approach with other combinations of state-of-the-art feature types and classifiers over a large-scale dataset we collected from Coursera. Considering the experimental results, we expect our approach can facilitate the development of Learning Analytics tools powered by Cognitive Computing to support content managers on micro-learning video management while improving how learners search videos.

Harnessing the power of big data analytics in the cloud to support learning analytics in mobile learning environment,Mobile learning (m-learning); Learning analytics; Big data analytics; Cloud computing; Map reduce technique; Technology acceptance model (TAM),TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE,"Technology enhanced learning (TEL) such as online learning environment with adaptive technologies has gained growing interest in recent past in the field of teaching and learning. In this context, mobile learning has got much momentum and is exemplified by diverse characteristics associated with the technologies and devices used, the enormous size of data generated throughout a learning session, and the interactions among the learners that occur outside the classroom. Consequently, sophisticated data analysis techniques are required to handle the intricacy of mobile learning and analyze the vast amount of datasets to enhance the learning experiences of mobile learners. This has led to the adoption of big data analytics for efficient processing of big learning data to add value to the mobile learning environments. Yet limited processing capability of the mobile devices is another key challenge faced by such big data analytics in mobile learning environments. To overcome this limitation, certain heavy computational parts could be offloaded to the cloud which can provide enough computation and storage resources. To this end, this paper presents a cloud based mobile learning framework that utilizes big data analytics technique to extract values from huge volume of mobile learners' data. Finally, we investigate learners' readiness and driving factors of mobile learning adoption in higher education institutions. In particular, we propose a hypothesized model for mobile learning adoption built on a locally extended technology acceptance model (TAM)."
Assessing learners' satisfaction in collaborative online courses through a big data approach,Big data; Clustering; Collaborative learning; Learning analytics; Learning satisfaction; Sentiment analysis,STUDENT SATISFACTION; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; DESIGN SCIENCE; DECISION TREE; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM,"Monitoring learners' satisfaction (LS) is a vital action for collecting precious information and design valuable online collaborative learning (CL) experiences. Today's CL platforms allow students for performing many online activities, thus generating a huge mass of data that can be processed to provide insights about the level of satisfaction on contents, services, community interactions, and effort. Big Data is a suitable paradigm for real-time processing of large data sets concerning the LS, in the final aim to provide valuable information that may improve the CL experience. Besides, the adoption of Big Data offers the opportunity to implement a non-intrusive and in-process evaluation strategy of online courses that complements the traditional and time-consuming ways to collect feedback (e.g. questionnaires or surveys). Although the application of Big Data in the CL domain is a recent explored research area with limited applications, it may have an important role in the future of online education. By adopting the design science research methodology, this article describes a novel method and approach to analyse individual students' contributions in online learning activities and assess the level of their satisfaction towards the course. A software artefact is also presented, which leverages Learning Analytics in a Big Data context, with the goal to provide in real-time valuable insights that people and systems can use to intervene properly in the program. The contribution of this paper can be of value for both researchers and practitioners: the former can be interested in the approach and method used for LS assessment; the latter can find of interest the system implemented and how it has been tested in a real online course.

Identifying Students at Risk of Failing a Subject by Using Learning Analytics for Subsequent Customised Tutoring,learning analytics; customised tutoring; learning adaptation; virtual classroom,BIG DATA; EXPERIENCE; MODEL,"Learning analytics (LA) has become a key area of study in educology, where it could assist in customising teaching and learning. Accordingly, it is precisely this data analysis technique that is used in a sensor-AnalyTIC-designed to identify students who are at risk of failing a course, and to prompt subsequent tutoring. This instrument provides the teacher and the student with the necessary information to evaluate academic performance by using a risk assessment matrix; the teacher can then customise any tutoring for a student having problems, as well as adapt the course contents. The sensor was validated in a study involving 39 students in the first term of the Environmental Engineering program at the Cooperative University of Colombia. Participants were all enrolled in an Algorithms course. Our findings led us to assert that it is vital to identify struggling students so that teachers can take corrective measures. The sensor was initially created based on the theoretical structure of the processes and/or phases of LA. A virtual classroom was built after these phases were identified, and the tool for applying the phases was then developed. After the tool was validated, it was established that students' educational experiences are more dynamic when teachers have sufficient information for decision-making, and that tutoring and content adaptation boost the students' academic performance."
Does competency-based education with blockchain signal a new mission for universities?,Learning analytics; artificial intelligence; mission strategy; soft skills; authentic assessment,LEARNING ANALYTICS,"New technologies and the knowledge economy are destabilising graduate professions, with artificial intelligence and the analysis of 'big data' making significant impacts on formerly secure jobs. Blockchain technology, offering automated secure credentialling of undergraduate students' activities and achievements, may significantly erode existing systems of assessment. The challenge for universities will be not only to maintain the relevance of their curricula but also to manage erosion of their current near-monopoly in awarding degrees. This paper envisions a landscape in which universities must outsource parts of their course delivery and assessment in order to remain competitive. It examines a potentially sustainable mission strategy: to move away from narrow academic disciplines towards an authentic learning curriculum focusing on the development of students as whole persons with rounded educations. This paper examines implications for the academy of the convergence of artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain technology."
"Kratos: A secure, authenticated and publicly verifiable system for educational data using the blockchain",educational data mining; learning analytics; data privacy; blockchain; distributed data management systems,,"Growing interest in educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) to leverage big data and to benefit education and the science of learning has made data ownership an important focus point for institutions and students. While EDM and LA can provide important information that help enhance the quality of teaching and learning, it has become critical to ensure data privacy and student agency over data. In this paper, we introduce Kratos: an immutable and publicly verifiable data management system that enables EDM and LA, while maintaining data privacy and empowering students with a user interface for data governance and participation in school processes. The system aims to achieve data interoperability, which facilitates EDM and LA as incentives to educational stakeholders (policy makers, educators, developers of education technologies, etc.), while prioritizing student agency over their data. Our system gives students and schools an immutable log along with comprehensive access to data that is otherwise scattered across systems and vendors. The underlying set of rules of the system are defined in a set of smart contracts, codified from existing non virtual agreements [1] between schools and education technology (edutech) vendors. We propose the smart contracts to be deployed on a public blockchain (like Ethereum or Bitcoin), for notarizing and time-stamping various interactions which users of Kratos may have with data Third parties requesting access to school data have a unique virtual token assigned to them on the blockchain which helps keep track of data modifications, access and use."
Academic Analytics as an Instrument for Data-Driven Innovations at HEIs,Academic Analytics; Educational Big Data; Performance Prediction; Educational Data Science; Data-driven Decisions,EDUCATION; COURSES,"The problem of smooth and synchronous integration of various types of e-learning and online courses, internships and extra-curricular activities into blended, systematic adaptive educational environment is becoming a new paradigm in innovations in educational process of higher education institutions (HEIs). But there are few studies that consistently discuss the impact of the systems providing analysis of educational outcomes (academic analytics systems) on quality of education and provision of integrated educational environment. This paper investigates role, application and taxonomy of academic analytics systems applied to the process of implementing innovative strategies in Higher Education. Such systems are intended to extract meaningful information from multiple data sources (learning management and content systems (LMS and LCS), online courses and other) to predict, cluster, find relations, and prepare data for decision making process aimed at creating knowledge crucial for improving the quality of educational process in HEIs. Academic analytics incorporate three main types of systems: Learning Analytics (LA), Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Educational Big Data (EBD) systems. As academic analytics research field is rapidly developing even though a considerable number of papers have provided substantial insight on the theoretical basis of LA, EDM and EBD systems, taxonomy, classification and differentiation of types of the systems are still undefined and often overlap. The main research question of the study is to examine the classification of academic analytical systems in higher education according to the needs and goals of universities and investigate impact of academic analytics in blending different types of educational activity and creation of integrated educational environment. Our findings are based on the analysis of papers on learning analytics in higher education published between 2010 and 2018."

Learning Analytics - Need of Centralized Portal for Access to E-Learning Resources,open educational resources; school education; centralized access portal; learning analytics; Big Data,IMAGES,"Recently, e-learning resources become widespread in school education worldwide, as they are a prerequisite for an efficient learning process. These resources are scattered across many websites and their search takes too long. Despite their diversity, often it is difficult for teachers to find the proper resources. After analyzing the findings of an anonymous online survey of Bulgarian teachers on the use of ICT and e-learning resources, researchers identified the need for easy access to various e-resources for school education. The paper offers a concept for a centralized access portal where users to upload links to e-learning resources that are shortly described and classified according to several indicators. These include accessibility, type, subject, school grade, purpose and other meaningful parameters. Free registration for teachers and students will allow data to be aggregated by user groups, to carry out analyzes of the resources' usage, to draw trends, and to make conclusions for future policies."
Method and System Constructing for Learning Situation Early Warning based on Data Mining Techniques,learning situation big data; under-performing learning situation evaluation; learning failure risk early warning; educational data mining,PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; ANALYTICS; STUDENTS,"At present, there are some problems in early warning of student learning situation, such as single assessment index, outdated technology method, lack of specialized information support system, time-delayed evaluation feedback and etc. In order to deal with these problems, in this study a complete learning situation evaluation and early warning system is proposed based on data mining techniques, which consists of evaluation index system, learning failure risk early warning model, result visualization method, and information support system.

"TOOLBOX.ACADEMY: CODING & ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MADE EASY FOR KIDS, BIG DATA FOR EDUCATORS",text-based programming; mainstream programming languages; problem-solving; curricular subjects; open formats; simplified coding environments; learning analytics; big data,,"Society has reached the point where there is considerable awareness about the need of teaching coding skills at the schools. Both, political leaders and educational systems start taking positions in this strategic new arena, but they lack from much of the expertise and necessary tools about how to teach this complex (but also intuitive to children and youngsters) field of knowledge. In this context, ToolboX Academy is a programming platform which subscribes a slightly new approach to attack the problem, in four differential aspects: 1) While most attention focuses on block-based approaches (Scratch and Code.org being the most popular initiatives), ToolboX embraces coding as it works for developers: text-based programming; 2) ToolboX embeds mainstream programming languages, which are widely used, are supported by big communities, are weakly typed, and closer to human natural language, like it is Javascript, for web applications, and GNU Octave, in engineering and scientific research; 3) it provides user-oriented problem-based learning, designed upon educational research results; and 4) it integrates curricular subjects in learning to code. In this paper, we review the design constraints taken into account to develop ToolboX Academy, and how it has been tested in the classroom. Some features are particularly stressed, like the use of open formats for content representation (definition of tasks or problems); the design of a simplified environment to represent most CS concepts, from basic loops to complex graph traversal strategies; and the use of learning analytics based on big data algorithms that can help educators and managers to learn from the interaction of their students with this environment."

These latter are often represented as data, which open up promising opportunities for their exploitation to improve teaching and learning operations. Nowadays, Learning Management Systems, Massive Open Online Courses and Tutoring Systems are the most exploited environment to extract useful data. Several researches are conducted to exploit data and interactions in measuring learner engagement, predicting analysis, early detection and many other applications. In another context and evermore in E-learning 2.0 field, our team has developed a collaborative social web IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to be used in practical computer science teaching. This environment virtualizes the sequence of practical work. It also enables the collaboration between student and teacher and students themselves. The use of our IDE in practical programming work has demonstrated a set of advantages. The results of its evaluation have been published in a prior work. In the presence of a rich interaction environment, where interactions are related to programming teaching in higher education. We aim to expand the use of our IDE in order to improve this operation by harnessing the data that we can collect in it. The first step, is to define the learning analytics specific to this operation that will allow us to collect useful data. We believe that after processing this data we will be able to exploit it to improve the operation of teaching and learning. The purpose of this work is to define a road map of the data that can be collected from web IDEs used in teaching as well as the possibilities of exploiting them."

Investigating Learners' Perception of Learning Analytics Dashboard to Improve Learning Interaction in Online Learning System,learning analytics; learning interaction; learner's perception,,"Big data has changed the approach in designing an e-Learning. When students interact with e-Learning content, automatically generating data, we can collect and trace their learning tracks. The data is processed and analyzed, then used to understand the behavioral characteristics of the user or student to enable a personalized learning experience. In this study, learning analytics dashboard was used to improve learning interaction which impacts the learning successfulness. Tests were conducted on 67 students in the Educational Technology Department of the State University of Malang and distributed questionnaires and then analyzed using descriptive methods. The result is that most of the students who take online learning using the learning analytics dashboard find it helpful to carry out self-evaluations of their interaction hence they can manage their learning. The results of the study showed that most participants agreed that LAD could provide information to them regarding their interactions with learning content (M = 4.15, SD = 0.557), learning environment (M = 4.13, SD = 0.457), as well as the participants could conduct problem identification during their learning process (M = 3.88, SD = 0.477)."
INTEGRATING LIFELONG LEARNING WITHIN THE SMART CITY PARADIGM,Lifelong Learning; Technology Enhanced Learning; Smart cities; e-Learning; Smart learning; Massively Open Online Courses,,"This paper considers the role of lifelong learning in modern society within a technology enhanced learning mediated environment and the impact of the dependence on technology on the strategic design of learning systems. The role of lifelong learning in modern economies and the diversity of activities associated with lifelong learning requires targeted resourcing and understanding of the meaning of lifelong learning. The hegemony of technology enhanced learning in modern education is accepted as a de-facto component in the design of any learning programme, however the pedagogical paradigms may not be fully understood. The literature on the nexus between the technology enhanced learning and the smart city emphasises the technology while focusing on learning analytics and big data applications. Evidence of the pedagogical paradigm requirements is not quite so visible and this lack of understanding of the complete model has the potential to create tensions in the design of lifelong learning systems. A project-based methodology over 2 years was employed via 8 collaborative learning programmes involving more than 500 participants drawn from high school and college graduate levels. All projects were designed to provide authentic learning experiences where participants were divided into groups of 6 to 8 in a supported open learning community environment. Each authentic project was designed to immerse the participants in a practical oriented and socially significant programme of learning. During the process the participants demonstrated mastery and socially aware interaction. The agency of active learning is considered in the sense of the triune of human, education and economic, systems for the sustainable growth of a knowledge economy."
LEARNING ANALYTICS FROM THE TEACHER'S PERSPECTIVE: A MOBILE APP,Learning Analytics; student big data; mobile app; teacher,IMPLEMENTATION; DESIGN,"The wide range of data produced by participants in the learning processes led to increased interest in the collection and analysis of data to support data-driven decision making at all levels of educational institutions. The paper is devoted to the emerging field of Learning Analytics from the teacher's perspective. It proposes a set of indicators that Learning Analytics should provide to help teachers be more reflective in their teaching practice, to improve the quality of education provided in their courses and relevance of the learning materials, to discover more about students' learning, to track and predict students' performance, to identify potential issues and students at risk.

Towards Open Data in Digital Education Platforms,open data; data management; data sharing; privacy; education; learning analytics; open research,,"Despite the traction gained by the open data movement and the rise of big data and learning analytics in education, there is limited support for researchers in education to generate, access, and share experimental data using openly-available digital education platforms. To explore how this gap could he addressed and elicit requirements, we conducted a survey with 40 researchers in the field of technology-enhanced learning, examining their experience and needs handling research data. Drawing on the results of our survey, we devised a set of features that educational platforms should provide to address the identified requirements, enabling researchers in education to run studies within typical learning environments, adhere to legal and ethical frameworks concerning privacy, and share their data confidently with a wider audience. We then categorized these features into five stages that represent the user flow, namely (1) Bootstrapping Research Studies, (2) Ensuring Consent, (3) Gathering Data, (4) Managing Data Sets, and (5) Supporting Open Research and Collaboration. Our aim is to guide forthcoming research and developments to relieve researchers of the burdens of conducting data-sensitive experiments, support the adoption of hest practices, and pave the way for open data policies in digital education."
LEARNING ANALYTICS FOR PROGRAMMING EDUCATION: OBSTACLES AND OPPORTUNITIES,Learning analytics; Programming education; Programming; Obstacles; Opportunities,,"During recent years the field of Learning Analytics have been frequently mentioned in discussions of addressing challenges in education, as well as a means to analyse and draw upon students' strengths in educational contexts. Prognoses for the future labour market show an increasing need of programmers, yet studies show that programming education struggle with student dropout, poor academic performance and low pass rates. The aim of this study was to analyse and discuss potential obstacles and opportunities in using learning analytics tools for forecasting student success in relation to course outcomes in programming education. This study was carried out as a literature review with a theorical framework for Learning Analytics presented by Yassine, Kadry and Sicilia (2016) in A framework for learning analytics in moodle for assessing course outcomes. In 2016 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) (pp. 261-266). IEEE. as the basis for a content analysis with deductive coding. Main keywords in the literature search was: learning analytics, programming, education, course, tool, obstacles, opportunities. Keywords were combined with the Boolean operators and and or. The literature search was limited to recently published research (between years 2015 and 2019). The study shows that learning analytics tools, if thoughtfully used, is an opportunity to forecast student success and improve educational design, both from the student perspective and from the teacher perspective. Learning analytics tools does not necessarily have to build on quantitative big data analyses only. From a teacher perspective it could be more valuable with a mixed method approach in the strive to improve existing course design. As pointed out in several research studies students' and teachers' integrity have to be respected. Today's virtual learning environments provide huge amounts of learning data, but as in all other types of research, this should build on informed consent. Finally, in a new approach of learning analytics the analyses preferably should include some teaching analytics as well, to better improve course design and learning outcomes."
Educational data mining: A tutorial for the rattle package in R,Educational data mining; rattle; Decision tree; Random forest; Support vector machines,CLASSIFICATION; ANALYTICS,"Educational data mining (EDM) has been a rapidly growing research field over the last decade and enabled researchers to discover patterns and trends in education with more sophisticated methods. EDM offers promising solutions to complex educational problems. Given the rapid increase in the availability of big data in education and software programs to analyze big data, the demand for user-friendly, free software programs to implement EDM methods also continues to increase.

Preview Analytics of ePUB3 eBook-based Flipped Classes Using a Big Data Approach,Flipped learning; Preview analytics; ePUB3 eBook; Big data BOOCs platform,LEARNING ANALYTICS; PERFORMANCE; MOTIVATION,"Flipped learning has been commonly used to provide students with learning contents inside/outside classrooms. It encourages students to preview learning contents before their classes. Thereafter, learning activities are taken in classes with instructions or help from the teacher. An important issue in the success of flipped learning is the effectiveness of students' preview because it affects the subsequent learning activities in their classes. Fortunately, for ePUB3 eBooks used in flipped classes, the embedded track and test functions can be used to track the accesses and tests taken on these eBooks. As such, the teacher can capture the effectiveness of students' preview by checking their pre-class accesses and tests, and hence take adequate actions for subsequent class activities. In this paper, we present an analytics approach investigating the effectiveness of students' preview. Their accesses and tests on ePUB3 eBooks are tracked, recorded, and analysed using a big data BOOCs (eBook Open Online Courses) platform. The approach is applied to a 3-class course at a university in Taiwan with 71 first-year students enrolled. As the results illustrate, the approach is useful for supporting teachers to take adequate actions in classes. Students' preview effectiveness is gradually enhanced in later classes."
Learning Analytics Research: Using Meta-Review to Inform Meta-Synthesis,Learning analytics; Metasynthesis; Educational data mining,HIGHER-EDUCATION; BIG DATA,"Research in learning analytics is proliferating as scholars continue to find better and more engaging ways to consider how data can help inform evidence-based decisions for learning and learning environments. With well over a thousand articles published in journals and conferences with respect to learning analytics, only a handful or articles exist that attempt to synthesize the research. Further, a meta-review of those articles reveals a lack of consistency in the scope of included studies, the confluence of educational data mining activities and big data as a parameter for inclusion, and the reporting of actual strategies and analytic methods used by the included studies. To fill these gaps within existing reviews of learning analytics research, this metasynthesis follows procedures outlined by Cooper to reveal developments of learning analytics research. The results include a number of metrics showing trends and types of learning analytic studies through 2017 that include which fields are publishing and to what extent, what methods and strategies are employed by these studies, and what domains remain largely yet unexplored."
An Ontological Framework for the Analysis of Constructively Aligned Educational Units,Constructive alignment; Learning analytics; Ontology,,"Higher education institutions are increasingly abandoning traditional teaching methods based on transmissive pedagogy and embracing a model based on the constructivist theory of learning. This is a necessary shift to face current challenges in their domain such as shrinking resources and need to reach students with different level of motivation and learning styles. Constructive Alignment (CA) combines the new pedagogical approach with aligned design for outcome-based teaching education and it is the leading approach under-pinning current requirements for program specification and single course description. Another important trend emerging from digitalization of higher education is the collection and use of educational data to improve all the aspects of the learning process. This research community has produced a large body of valuable tools and methods, but there is no specific contribution targeting the analysis of constructively aligned education. The CONALI ontology is an ongoing modelling effort that currently provides a framework to describe the CA body of knowledge including all the relevant semantic relationships. This paper presents a new version of such ontology that supports collection and analysis of educational data from constructively aligned educational units as a first step to fill the gap described above. The specific requirements for this iterative upgrade have been inferred from a literature review of the typical analysis conducted in the domain of educational big data."

Market Basket Analysis of Student Attendance Records,Educational data mining; Learning analytics; Mining student behavior,BIG DATA,"Many educational institutions enforce attendance policies, where students are expected to have their absences below a certain percentage in each class. Attendance records are collected to enforce such policies, but they are rarely utilized for anything else. In this paper, we investigate the value of analyzing the records pulled from student attendance systems. We apply a data mining technique, the market basket analysis, on student attendance data. The contribution of this analysis is the identification of student groups who share highly similar absence records. Such similarity may indicate that the students are missing classes due to peer pressure, rather than valid excuses. The presented method helps instructors and advisors discover this behavior, which is more efficient than relying on instructors, who may teach many classes. To minimize the number of false alarms, student groups are ranked based on their absence similarity. We tested our method by analyzing student attendance data for over two thousand students for one semester at a public higher education institution. The results were helpful in identifying students with miss classes due to their friends missing the classes."
It's My Data! Tensions Among Stakeholders of a Learning Analytics Dashboard,Learning analytics; early warning dashboards; higher education; student data; privacy; ethics,PRIVACY PRINCIPLES; BIG DATA; PERCEPTIONS; STUDENTS; ISSUES,"Early warning dashboards in higher education analyze student data to enable early identification of underperforming students, allowing timely interventions by faculty and staff. To understand perceptions regarding the ethics and impact of such learning analytics applications, we conducted a multi-stakeholder analysis of an early-warning dashboard deployed at the University of Michigan through semi-structured interviews with the system's developers, academic advisors (the primary users), and students. We identify multiple tensions among and within the stakeholder groups, especially with regard to awareness, understanding, access and use of the system. Furthermore, ambiguity in data provenance and data quality result in differing levels of reliance and concerns about the system among academic advisors and students. While students see the system's benefits, they argue for more involvement, control, and informed consent regarding the use of student data. We discuss our findings' implications for the ethical design and deployment of learning analytics applications in higher education."

Using big data techniques for measuring productive friction in mass collaboration online environments,Learning; Knowledge construction; Productive friction; Big data; Wikipedia,LEARNING ANALYTICS; SOCIAL MEDIA; KNOWLEDGE CONSTRUCTION; CONFIRMATION BIAS; NETWORK ANALYSIS; RECOMMENDATIONS; COEVOLUTION; COMMUNITIES; PSYCHOLOGY; WIKIPEDIA,"The advent of the social web brought with it challenges and opportunities for research on learning and knowledge construction. Using the online-encyclopedia Wikipedia as an example, we discuss several methods that can be applied to analyze the dynamic nature of knowledge-related processes in mass collaboration environments. These methods can help in the analysis of the interactions between the two levels that are relevant in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) research: The individual level of learners and the collective level of the group or community. In line with constructivist theories of learning, we argue that the development of knowledge on both levels is triggered by productive friction, that is, the prolific resolution of socio-cognitive conflicts. By describing three prototypical methods that have been used in previous Wikipedia research, we review how these techniques can be used to examine the dynamics on both levels and analyze how these dynamics can be predicted by the amount of productive friction. We illustrate how these studies make use of text classifiers, social network analysis, and cluster analysis in order to operationalize the theoretical concepts. We conclude by discussing implications for the analysis of dynamic knowledge processes from a learning sciences perspective."

The proposed career development framework utilizes social network analytics, influence diffusion algorithms and persuasive technology models along three phases: (1) career readiness to measure and visualize the general cognitive dispositions required for a successful career in the 21st Century, (2) career prediction to persuade future graduates into a desired career path by clustering learners whose career prospects are deemed similar, into a community of practice; and (3) career development to drive growth within a social network structure where social network analytics and persuasive techniques are applied to incite the adoption of desired career behaviors. The process starts by discovering behavioral features to create a cognitive profile and diagnose individual deficiencies. Then, we develop a fuzzy clustering algorithm that predicts similar patterns with controlled constraint-violations to construct a social structure for collaborative cognitive attainment. This social framework facilitates the deployment of novel influence diffusion approaches, whereby we propose a reciprocal-weighted similarity function and a triadic closure approach. In doing so, we investigate contemporary social network analytics to maximize influence diffusion across a synthesized social network. The outcome of this social computing approach leads to a persuasive model that supports behavioral changes and developments. The performance results obtained from both analytical and experimental evaluations validate our data-driven strategy for persuasive behavioral change."
Applying Learning Analytics for the Early Prediction of Students' Academic Performance in Blended Learning,Learning analytics; Educational big data; MOOCs; Blended learning; Principal component regression,ONLINE; ENVIRONMENTS; INFORMATION; MOOCS,"Blended learning combines online digital resources with traditional classroom activities and enables students to attain higher learning performance through well-defined interactive strategies involving online and traditional learning activities. Learning analytics is a conceptual framework and as a part of our Precision education used to analyze and predict students' performance and provide timely interventions based on student learning profiles. This study applied learning analytics and educational big data approaches for the early prediction of students' final academic performance in a blended Calculus course. Real data with 21 variables were collected from the proposed course, consisting of video-viewing behaviors, out-of-class practice behaviors, homework and quiz scores, and after-school tutoring. This study applied principal component regression to predict students' final academic performance. The experimental results show that students' final academic performance could be predicted when only one-third of the semester had elapsed. In addition, we identified seven critical factors that affect students' academic performance, consisting of four online factors and three traditional factors. The results showed that the blended data set combining online and traditional critical factors had the highest predictive performance."
What Learning Analytics Tells Us: Group Behavior Analysis and Individual Learning Diagnosis based on Long-Term and Large-Scale Data,Learning analytics; Learning analysis; Learning diagnostic; Online learning; Educational big data,HIGHER-EDUCATION; RISK STUDENTS; ONLINE,"The practice and application of education data mining and learning analytics has become the focus of educational researchers. However, it is still a difficult task to explore the law of group learning and the characteristics of individual learning. In this study, the online learning logs of 1,088 students from 22 classes were analyzed from the aspects of their login behaviors, resource utilization, quizzes, interactive behaviors, and academic achievement. To address these issues, multiple methods, including statistical analysis, visualization social network analysis and correlation analysis, were used to analyze the process and results of online learning. The results reveal the characteristics of group behavior of online learners and highlight the key factors that influence the learning process and outcomes of individual learners. From the view of students, these factors include the length and allocation of online time, the effective utilization of resources, social interaction, online learning support and services, etc. From the perspective of teachers, the factors include the management of online teaching, the appropriateness of learning resources, the effectiveness of online intervention strategies, the accurate feedback for online learners, etc. Therefore, learning analysis technology can not only standardize the assessment of learning outcomes, but can also focus more attention on the standardization of learning process assessment. It also identifies the main factors that affect the online learning outcomes and the group characteristics of online learners. At the same time, it provides the learners with personalized learning diagnosis reports which can both help learners understand their own learning status and promote instructors' accurate teaching and reasonable evaluation."
Are We on Our Way to Becoming a Helicopter University? Academics' Views on Learning Analytics,Learning analytics; Higher education; Academic attitudes; Big data,TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; STUDENTS,"Higher education institutions are developing the capacity for learning analytics. However, the technical development of learning analytics has far exceeded the consideration of ethical issues around learning analytics. We examined higher education academics' knowledge, attitudes, and concerns about the use of learning analytics though four focus groups (N = 35). Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts identified five key themes. The first theme, 'Facilitating learning', represents academics' perceptions that, while currently unrealized, there could be several benefits to learning analytics that would help their students. Three themes; 'Where are the ethics?', 'What about the students!', and 'What about me!' represented academics' perceptions of how learning analytics could pose some considerable difficulties within a higher education context. A final theme 'Let's move forward together' reflected that despite some challenges and concerns about learning analytics, academics perceived scope for learning analytics to be beneficial if there is collaboration between academics, students, and the university. The findings highlight the need to include academics in the development of learning analytics policies and procedures to promote the suitability and widespread adoption of learning analytics in the higher education sector."
"A Middle-School Module for Introducing Data-Mining, Big-Data, Ethics and Privacy Using RapidMiner and a Hollywood Theme",,,"Today's organizations, including online businesses, use the art of data-driven decision-making i.e. business-intelligence (BI) to benefit from all the data out in the open. Given the current market demand for BI skill-sets, including the knowledge of different sources and tools for data-collection plus processing, today's youth need a basic understanding of data-driven intelligence, and an awareness of big-data related ethics and privacy. However, there has been limited research and development work towards designing an effective educational module in this regard at the K-12 level. We intend to address this particular limitation by presenting a uniquely engaging middle-school learning module based upon a combination of useful topics, like data-mining, predictive-analytics, data-visualization, big-data, ethics and privacy, using the free RapidMiner software-tool. The novelty of our module lies in the use of a GUI-based visual hands-on platform (RapidMiner), a Hollywood movie-theme based educational activity, as well as an added focus on big-data ethics and privacy, and its conceptual mapping to the NSA-GenCyber security-first principles. We discuss and analyze the survey data obtained from over hundred participants through several offerings of our module as an educational workshop through our Google-IgniteCS and NSA-GenCyber programs. The collected learning-analytics data indicate that our module can become a simple yet effective means for introducing data-mining, big-data, ethical and privacy issues, and GenCyber security-first principles at the middle-school level. Our results show prospects of motivating middle-school participants towards further learning of topics in data-science, data-ethics and data-security, which is necessary today in a variety of professions."

How Big Data Analytics Will Reshape e-Learning?,big data; data mining; social networks; cognitive biometrics technologies,,"Over the last several years, analytics and data mining have become new challenges for educational field and the idea of using the great benefits of automated methods for making sense of educational data received a significant boost. This paper gives an overview about learning analytics and educational data mining and also explains the way they are used in order to improve the support for educators and learners in their strive to achieve high quality learning outcomes (or results) and the way they improve decision making process in academic environment to maximize strategic outcomes. The amount of data being digitally collected and stored is vast and heterogeneous. As a result, the science of data management and analysis is also advancing to enable educational field to convert this vast resource into information and knowledge that helps teachers and educational organizations to achieve their objectives. Computer scientists have invented the term big data to describe this evolving technology. Big data has been successfully used in the many areas of activity, and the e-learning in particular. New educational technologies have allowed students, educators and managers to generate tremendous data via mobile devices, learning management systems, social networks, cognitive biometrics technologies and so on, resulting in what has been called as big data. Learning analytics and educational data mining techniques allow big data to be analysed from different perspectives, including monitoring students' activities, designing pedagogical interventions to support students, prediction of the learning success, failure, and potential dropouts, adaptation/personalization of learning content and learning tasks. Sometimes, in order to apply automated methods to analyse an educational context, it is required the use some type of personal data that should help university to build detailed student profile, and achieve competitive advantage.

A Big Data Analytics Tool for Social Learning Management Systems,learning analytics; clustering algorithms; big data; learning management systems,,"Recent technologies are an opportunity for creating advanced data analytics tools for various domains. There are diverse methods based on smart technologies for implementing and supporting data analytics in educational environments, e.g. descriptive methods (reports), diagnostic methods (automated analysis), predictive and prescriptive methods (recommendations, alerts). The educational data come from online surveys, biometric sources, but, mostly, from activities in learning management systems (LMS). The current paper presents a new learning analytics instrument - LeProVE - uCluster for Moodie LMS, which creates virtual profiles of the students and aggregates those profiles into clusters which are further used by teachers to optimize the teaching process. The tool is suitable for today's social and cultural values, as the students' performances (reflected in grades, completed assignments) are not analysed only based on a standard a priori settled by the teacher, but considering the colleagues' performances and social interactions as well. Thus, the teacher can use the results obtained by using LeProVE - uCluster to adjust the homework/exams difficulty to the class context and can recommend further useful resources to individual students and clusters of students. The technologies and methods which are used to implement our instrument are modern: Scala, Spark - a general engine for big data processing, Angular JS, data mining algorithms (K-Means) and Big Data Sampling algorithms. To validate the functionality of the proposed tool, we used 2167 anonymised students' profiles which were imported from a Moodie data set freely available for research purposes. Possible interpretations of data and directions to be followed by teachers to improve their teaching skills are also offered."

Anlaying Learners Behavior in MOOCs: An Examination of Performance and Motivation Using a Data-Driven Approach,Machine learning; massive open online courses; statistical analysis; big data,ONLINE COURSES; DECISION TREES; STRATEGIES,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have been experiencing increasing use and popularity in highly ranked universities in recent years. The opportunity of accessing high quality courseware content within such platforms, while eliminating the burden of educational, financial, and geographical obstacles has led to a rapid growth in participant numbers. The increasing number and diversity of participating learners has opened up new horizons to the research community for the investigation of effective learning environments. Learning Analytics has been used to investigate the impact of engagement on student performance. However, the extensive literature review indicates that there is little research on the impact of MOOCs, particularly in analyzing the link between behavioral engagement and motivation as predictors of learning outcomes. In this paper, we consider a dataset, which originates from online courses provided by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, delivered through the edX platform. Two sets of empirical experiments are conducted using both statistical and machine learning techniques. Statistical methods are used to examine the association between engagement level and performance, including the consideration of learner educational backgrounds. The results indicate a significant gap between success and failure outcome learner groups, where successful learners are found to read and watch course material to a higher degree. Machine learning algorithms are used to automatically detect learners who are lacking in motivation at an early time in the course, thus providing instructors with insight in regards to student withdrawal."

FOCUSING ON UNDERGRADUATES' BEHAVIOUR. LEARNING ANALYTICS IN HUMAN HISTOLOGY,Higher Education; Innovation; Assessment; Management; Student,,"Big data is an emerging field of research and many organizations especially governments, business and health care currently use them to make informed decisions. Millions of generated data are unstructured and come in a variety of formats. Nowadays, data technologies make possible to collect and store large and complex amounts of data and then to turn them into meaningful patterns. In higher education, there is limited research into big data despite it would bring opportunities to inform decisions and to identify potential issues related to policies, programs, teaching, learning and research. When learners interact with a digital device (smartphone, tablet or laptop) data about their interactions are easily logged and so can be used for further analysis. The trails that students leave behind can be analyzed and could reveal social connections, behaviors, preferences and goals. A large field of research opens to identify patterns and deviations from patterns, addressing some of the key challenges facing higher education. Spanish Universities have deployed different platforms to support teaching and learning. An important part of the teachers still uses the digital environment as a sort of digital photocopy service. However, some teachers make an advanced use of the virtual campus with tasks, exams, wikis and forums and other activities. The Universidad Complutense of Madrid has started some actions to allow the analysis of the students' interactions and to examine patterns of students' performance. We describe in this paper one of these pilot experiences focused on Human Histology, a subject in the second year of the Medicine Degree. Three are the main aims of this experience. First of all, to propose a working methodology to gather the data, to define the metrics and to set up the indicators that may be useful to identify patterns in the undergraduate students' learning. Secondly, to evaluate the results in order to make better decisions that achieve better outcomes. Finally, to reflect on the metrics and indicators that could be useful to measure in other subjects and knowledge areas."
Millipede: Die-Stacked Memory Optimizations for Big Data Machine Learning Analytics,,,"The technology-push of die stacking and application-pull of Big Data machine learning analytics (BMLA) have created a unique opportunity for processing-near-memory (PNM). This paper makes four contributions: (1) While previous PNM work explores general MapReduce workloads, we identify three application characteristics of most BMLAs: (a) irregular-and-compute-light (i.e., perform only a few operations per input word which include data-dependent branches and indirect memory accesses); (b) compact (i.e., the relevant portion of the input data and the intermediate live data for each thread are small); and (c) memory-row-dense (i.e., process the input data without skipping over many bytes). These characteristics, except for irregularity, are necessary for bandwidth-and energy-efficient PNM, irrespective of the architecture. (2) Based on these characteristics, we propose memory optimizations for a sea of simple MIMD cores (SSMC) PNM architecture, called Millipede, which (pre) fetches and operates on entire memory rows to exploit BMLAs' row-density. Instead of this row-oriented access and compute-schedule, traditional multicores opportunistically improve row locality while fetching and operating on cache blocks. (3) Millipede employs well-known MIMD execution to handle BMLAs' irregularity, and sequential prefetch of input data to hide memory latency. In Millipede, however, one corelet prefetches a row for all the corelets which may stray far from each other due to their MIMD execution. Consequently, a leading corelet may prematurely evict the prefetched data before a lagging corelet has consumed the data. Millipede employs cross-corelet flow-control to prevent such eviction. (4) Millipede further exploits its flow-controlled prefetch for frequency scaling based on coarse-grain compute-memory rate-matching which decreases (increases) the processor clock speed when the prefetch buffers are empty (full). Using simulations, we compare PNM architectures to show that Millipede improves performance and energy, by 135% and 27% over a GPGPU with prefetch, and by 35% and 36% over SSMC with prefetch, when all three PNM architectures use the same resources (i.e., number of cores and on-processor-die memory) and identical die-stacking."
Instruction in College Physics Experiments in the Context of Big Data,Big data; College physics experiment; Teaching; Learning,,"Mining big data produced by students learning through mobile learning (m-learning) and ubiquitous learning (u-learning) can promote instructional effectiveness. So, in learning physics experiments, the big data should be recorded, mined and used. This paper analyses the research results on m-learning, u-learning and educational big data. It includes five parts. Firstly, it deals with the promotion of personalised adaptive learning, where educational data mining and learning analytics can be used to help students find the best learning methods and resources for physics experiments, when needed. Secondly, it considers the digitising of a university physics experiment course for recording resource usage and the experimental operation process. Thirdly, it examines the reform of the teaching of physics experiments, in which teachers provide rich e-learning resources and a useful communication platform for recording the data produced by students and adjust their teaching methods and strategies for different students. Fourthly, it discusses the reform of the method for learning physics experiments, in which students adopt blended learning which combines informal after-class learning and formal classroom experiment learning, and uses the prediction function of big data to change their learning method for different experiments. Finally, the paper looks at the reform of the evaluation method for physics experiments to reflect more objectively students' actual levels of performance by analysing the whole process."
Big data academic and learning analytics: Connecting the dots for academic excellence in higher education,Business value; Big data analytics,BUSINESS ANALYTICS; STUDENT; CAPABILITIES; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; SUCCESS; PRIVACY; SYSTEM; PATH,"Purpose Although big data analytics (BDA) have great benefits for higher education institutions (HEIs), due to lack of sufficient evidence on how BDA investment can pay off, it is tough for HEIs practitioners to realize value from such adoption. The purpose of this paper is to propose a big data academic and learning analytics enabled business value model to explain BDA potential benefits and business value which can be obtained by developing such analytics capabilities in HEIs. Design/methodology/approach The study examined 47 case descriptions from 26 HEIs to investigate the causal association between the BDA current and potential benefits and business value creation path for big data academic and learning analytics success in HEIs. Findings The pressure of compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements and competition had pushed HEIs hard to adopt BDA tools. However, the study found out that application of risk and security and predictive analytics to higher education fields is still in its infancy. Using this theoretical model, the results provide new insights to higher education administrators on ways to create BDA capabilities for HEIs transformation and suggest an empirical foundation that can lead to more thorough analysis of BDA implementation. Originality/value A distinctive theoretical contribution of this study is its conceptualization of understanding business value from BDA in the typical setting of higher education. The study provides HEIs with an all-inclusive understanding of BDA and gives insights on how it helps to transform HEIs. The new perspectives associated with the big data academic and learning analytics enabled business value model will contribute to future research in this area."

Learning analytics provides a way forward. This commentary describes how learning analytics-based applications are well positioned to meaningfully personalize the learning experience in diverse ways. In so doing, learning analytics has the potential to contribute to more equitable and socially just educational outcomes for students who might otherwise be seen through the lens of the average student. Utilizing big data, good design, and the input of the stakeholders, learning analytics techniques aim to develop applications for the sole purpose of reducing the classroom size to 1. Over time, these digital innovations will enable us to do away with a model of education that teaches toward the non-existent average student, replacing it with one that is more socially just-one that addresses the individual needs of every student."

Measuring Engagement to Assess Performance of Students in Distance Learning,Data Analytics; Learning Analytics; Educational Data Mining; Distance Learning; Online Discussion,ANALYTICS,"Organizations continuously invest in the analysis of accumulated data by linking their exploitation to more effective decision making. Higher education and especially distance learning as a large data tank, follows the technological and financial needs to involve more flexible data analysis environments and better data-informed decision capabilities. Shrinking public subsidies drives higher education to form a more competitive learning environment. Satisfactory user experience and personalized services require a quantitative and qualitative analysis of students' daily action in learning environments. The increasing adoption of Learning Analytics (LA) and Educational Data Mining (EDM) push the development of novel approaches and advancements in education sector. At the same time, the rapid disclosure of hidden knowledge and the immediate presentation of results to optimize personalized decision making is a challenge for the competitiveness of distance learning. The objective of this study is the analysis of processes, technologies and resources used in an annual module at the Hellenic Open University to provide stakeholders with the visibility of interactions and hidden value in students' interactions. LA technologies are used on large set of data that has been collected by a Moodle platform and carefully analyzed. Students' logins, replies and quizzes are blended with the average grade of the main written exercises during the academic year. The contribution of this work is the useful observations from the students' educational on-line activities as predictive factors for their academic performance."
University Teachers' and Students' Expectations on Learning Analytics,learning analytics; qualitative analysis; big data; small data; scenario-based approach; contemporary learning approach,,"Learning analytics (LA) is a promising tool to support learning and retention in studies; so far, many applications have been developed to make use of big data saved automatically while using online learning management systems. However, it is not clear how different applications support the contemporary learning approach or how they are valued by both teachers and students. Therefore, a qualitative study was conducted to explore university teachers' and students' expectations on LA. Several scenarios were provided to them in order to feed their ideas about the potential of LA. The results were linked to the characteristics of the contemporary learning approach. This showed that while self-regulation is the most often supported objective enhanced by LA, collaboration skills and subjective well-being need much more attention. It was also found that students were more positive than teachers in starting to use LA and teachers' opinions varied greatly."

Data Mining and Machine Learning in Education with Focus in Undergraduate CS Student Success,STEM student retention; graduation pathways; educational data mining; graph data mining,,"Computer science (CS) enrollments are at an all-time high, [1] and successful undergraduate CS graduations are indisputably important. With a student population of approximately 51,000, Georgia State University is a USA based state university which is diverse and forms a rich big data footprint as students navigate pathways to graduation. Quoted in a July 2017 article from HigherEd.com, Georgia State's extensive predictive analytics efforts are leading to better grades and student retention - and more minorities graduating from STEM programs. This doctoral project builds upon current data mining and modeling, machine learning applications, and learning analytics for predicting student success that is beyond retention. Gaining knowledge of CS student learning, developing better alerting models for success, and discovering behavioral indicators from learning analytics reporting is the goal of this research. Using this knowledge as evidence based data for improving the CS student experience will aid in performance improvements and increase pathways to graduation. My supporting research project is building CS student datasets to represent the student as directed graphical models, investigating their relationships using machine learning frameworks, and complex mathematical computations (tensors or gradient boosting) along with graph data mining techniques."
A Framework for Big Data Analysis in Smart Cities,Big data; E-learning; Smart learning; Smart systems; Smart cities; Learning Analytics; Internet of Things,,"Due to the rapid change in technologies, new data forms exist which lead to a huge data size on the internet. As a result, some learning platforms such as e-learning systems must change their methodologies for data processing to be smarter. This paper proposes a framework for smoothly adapt the traditional e-learning systems to be suitable for smart cities applications. Learning Analytics (LA) has turned into a noticeable worldview with regards to instruction of late which embraces the current progressions of innovation, for example, cloud computing, big data processing, and Internet of Things. LA additionally requires a concentrated measure of preparing assets to create applicable investigative outcomes. Be that as it may, the customary methodologies have been wasteful at handling LA difficulties."
Learning As It Happens: A Decade of Analyzing and Shaping a Large-Scale Online Learning System,Adaptive learning; educational games; exploring quality of fit; adaptive item selection; evaluation of CAL systems,,"With the advent of computers in education, and the ample availability of online learning and practice environments, enormous amounts of data on learning become available. The purpose of this paper is to present a decade of experience with analyzing and improving an online practice environment for math, which has thus far recorded over a billion responses. We present the methods we use to both steer and analyze this system in real-time, using scoring rules on accuracy and response times, a tailored rating system to provide both learners and items with current ability and difficulty ratings, and an adaptive engine that matches learners to items. Moreover, we explore the quality of fit by means of prediction accuracy and parallel item reliability. Limitations and pitfalls are discussed by diagnosing sources of misfit, like violations of unidimensionality and unforeseen dynamics. Finally, directions for development are discussed, including embedded learning analytics and a focus on online experimentation to evaluate both the system itself and the users' learning gains. Though many challenges remain open, we believe that large steps have been made in providing methods to efficiently manage and research educational big data from a massive online learning system."
Developing and rewarding teachers as educators and scholars: remarkable progress and daunting challenges,,HEALTH-PROFESSIONS EDUCATION; US MEDICAL-SCHOOLS; FACULTY-DEVELOPMENT; ACADEMIC MEDICINE; IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE; TEACHING EFFECTIVENESS; BIG DATA; COMPENSATION; COMPETENCES; PROMOTION,"ContextThis article describes the scholarly work that has addressed the fifth recommendation of the 1988 World Conference on Medical Education: Train teachers as educators, not content experts alone, and reward excellence in this field as fully as excellence in biomedical research or clinical practice'. ProgressOver the past 30 years, scholars have defined the preparation needed for teaching and other educator roles, and created faculty development delivery systems to train teachers as educators. To reward the excellence of educators, scholars have expanded definitions of scholarship, defined educator roles and criteria for judging excellence, and developed educator portfolios to make achievements visible for peer review. Despite these efforts, the scholarship of discovery continues to be more highly prized and rewarded than the scholarship of teaching. These values are deeply embedded in university culture and policies. ChallengesTo remedy the structural inequalities between researchers and educators, a holistic approach to rewarding the broad range of educational roles and educational scholarship is needed. This requires strong advocacy to create changes in academic rewards and support policies, provide a clear career trajectory for educators using learning analytics, expand programmes for faculty development, support health professions education scholarship units and academies of medical educators, and create mechanisms to ensure high standards for all educators. The authors describe scholarly research and institutional changes designed to develop and reward teachers as educators and scholars but assert that challenges remain to treat educators as equitably as researchers."

Data Power in Education: Exploring Critical Awareness with the Learning Analytics Report Card,learning analytics; education; data; power; black boxing; computational analysis,BIG DATA,"The burgeoning field of learning analytics (LA) is gaining significant traction in education, bolstered by the increasing amounts of student data generated through educational software. However, critical discussions of LA are in short supply. Drawing on work in the cultural studies of data and critical algorithm studies, this paper begins by examining three central issues: the distancing and black boxing of LA disciplinary practices, the mythologizing of objective data, and the concern for future prediction. The second section describes the design and implementation of the Learning Analytics Report Card (LARC), a pilot project that sought to develop experimental approaches to LA. As such, rather than seeking to simply produce analytics, the LARC attempted to foster critical awareness of computational data analysis among teachers and learners."
Who prophets from big data in education? New insights and new challenges,Data-driven assessment; educational data mining; ethics; personalized learning; policy; privacy,TOOL,"Big Data can radically transform education by enabling personalized learning, deep student modeling, and true longitudinal studies that compare changes across classrooms, regions, and years. With these promises, however, come risks to individual privacy and educational validity, along with deep policy and ethical issues. Education is largely a public service targeted primarily at minors. Participation is compulsory in most advanced societies, and in many ways, it is seen as a fundamental right. Academic success is necessary for advancement, but students often have little individual say in the process. For these reasons, it poses unique policy challenges that do not arise in other domains. Big data requires deep and constant monitoring of students, classes, and instructors. Who consents to such monitoring, and how will student or instructor privacy be preserved? Data also has immense commercial value. Who owns it? And who is permitted to profit from its use? In this article, I will discuss some of these unique issues, and I will outline some potential approaches that may be taken to address them."
Big data and the liberal conception of education,Big data; civic education; individuality; liberalism,EQUALITY,"This article develops a perspective on big data in education, drawing on a broadly liberal conception of education's primary purpose. We focus especially on the rise of so-called learning analytics and the associated rise of digitization, which we evaluate according to the liberal view that education should seek to cultivate individuality and proceed partly by way of experimentation and with an emphasis on civic education. Our argument is not that the use of big data is wholly out of place in education. Indeed, it might have significant value in pursuit of certain educational aims. Nevertheless, the liberal conception shows how education is distinct from other domains in which big data are being applied, in ways that suggest that considerable caution must be exercised when they are used in educational contexts."
Educational justice and big data,Bias; big data; discrimination; distributive justice; educational equality; peer effects; positional goods,EQUALITY,"This article examines the effects of incorporating information and communication technologies in schools in terms of distributive justice. To do so, four issues that are central to educational justice are discussed: scarcity of resources, the positional nature of education, peer effects, and biases in educational decision-making. The discussion exposes a complicated picture of possible benefits and challenges associated with incorporating data-rich technologies in education. While technology may potentially promote educational justice - by widening access to quality teaching, decreasing biases, and facilitating mixed ability classes - it also creates concerns, related to ensuring equal distribution of technology, preventing biases in educational data mining, and fostering the kind of social relations between students necessary for democratic equality. The article concludes that whether or not information and communication technologies will have a positive impact on educational justice depends, largely, on the way it is developed, designed, and implemented in schools."
The perceptions of the meaning and value of analytics in New Zealand higher education institutions,Analytics; Higher education; Perceived values; Challenges,LEARNING ANALYTICS; BIG DATA; CHALLENGES,"This article presents the current perceptions on the value of analytics and their possible contribution to the higher education sector in New Zealand. Seven out of eight research-intensive public universities in New Zealand took part in the study. Participants included senior management and those who have some role associated with decision-making within higher education (N = 82). The study found inconsistent understanding of the meaning of analytics across participants. In particular, three forms of perceptions of analytics were identified: structural; functional and structural-functional. It was evident that some participants viewed analytics in its structural elements such as statistics, metrics, trends, numbers, graph, and any relevant information/data to enhance better decision-making, whereas other participants perceived the notion of analytics in terms of functional aspect; as means to an end, a process to use the data to gain insights and taking action on complex problems, yet a third group viewed analytics from both structural-functional perspectives. These kinds of perceptions have to a larger extent influenced participants' views on the value of analytics in shaping policy and practice. Also, literature has addressed a number of possible challenges associated with the large-scale institutional implementation of analytics. These challenges were: difficulties in extracting data from multiple databases, maintaining data quality, ethical and privacy issues, and lack of professional development opportunities. This article aims to broadly contribute to a better understanding of current perception and value of analytics in higher education, and in particular within the New Zealand context."

Give Me a Customizable Dashboard: Personalized Learning Analytics Dashboards in Higher Education,Learning analytics; Higher education; Student attitudes; Student dashboards; Big data,PERCEIVED ACADEMIC CONTROL; STUDENTS,"With the increased capability of learning analytics in higher education, more institutions are developing or implementing student dashboards. Despite the emergence of dashboards as an easy way to present data to students, students have had limited involvement in the dashboard development process. As part of a larger program of research examining student and academic perceptions of learning analytics, we report here on work in progress exploring student perceptions of dashboards and student preferences for dashboard features. First, we present findings on higher education students' attitudes towards learning analytic dashboards resulting from four focus groups (N = 41). Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts identified five key themes relating to dashboards: 'provide everyone with the same learning opportunities', 'to compare or not to compare', 'dashboard privacy', 'automate alerts' and 'make it meaningful-give me a customizable dashboard'. Next we present findings from a content analysis of students' drawings of dashboards demonstrating that students are interested in features that support learning opportunities, provide comparisons to peers and are meaningful to the student. Finally, we present preliminary findings from a survey of higher education students, reinforcing students' desire to choose whether to have a dashboard and to be able to customize their dashboards. These findings highlight the potential for providing students with some level of control over learning analytics as a means to increasing self-regulated learning and academic achievement. Future research directions aimed at better understanding students emotional and behavioral responses to learning analytics feedback on dashboards and alerts are outlined."
Using Data to Understand How to Better Design Adaptive Learning,Adaptive learning; Personalized learning; Learning analytics; Data visualization,SYSTEM; ANALYTICS; STYLES,"There is much enthusiasm in higher education about the benefits of adaptive learning and using big data to investigate learning processes to make data-informed educational decisions. The benefits of adaptive learning to achieve personalized learning are obvious. Yet, there lacks evidence-based research to understand how data such as user behavior patterns can be used to design effective adaptive learning systems. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to investigate what behavior patterns learners with different characteristics demonstrate when they interact with an adaptive learning environment. Incoming 1st-year students in a pharmacy professional degree program engaged in an adaptive learning intervention that aimed to provide remedial instruction to better prepare these professional students before they began their formal degree program. We analyzed the participants' behavior patterns through the usage data to understand how they used the adaptive system based upon their needs and interests. Using both statistical analyses and data visualization techniques, this study found: (1) apart from learners' cognitive ability, it is important to consider affective factors such as motivation in adaptive learning, (2) lack of alignment among various components in an adaptive system can impact how learners accessed the system and, more importantly, their performance, and (3) visualizations can reveal interesting findings that can be missed otherwise. Such research should provide much needed empirical evidences and useful insights about how the analytics can inform the effective designs of adaptive learning."

In this paper, we depart from the core emphasis on application and delve into a mostly neglected aspect of the big data conversation in higher education. Drawing on developments in cognate disciplines, we analyse the inherent difficulties in inferring the complex phenomenon that is learning from big datasets. This forms the basis of a discussion about the possibilities for systematic collaboration across different paradigms and disciplinary backgrounds in interpreting big data for enhancing learning. The aim of this paper is to provide the foundation for a research agenda, where differing conceptualisations of learning become a strength in interpreting patterns in big datasets, rather than a point of contention."

In the Big Data era, the explosive growth of massive data manipulations imposes a heavy burden on computation, storage, and communication in data centers. Increasing uncertainties in information system availability have become a daily serious problem. An appropriate evaluation and selection of the right information system disaster recovery (DR) site can ensure business continuity and investment optimization. However, most academic institutes always neglect the importance of DR. Not to mention the DR sites in the era of Big Data. Existing research results do not evaluate or select DR sites in general or those for academic Big Data applications in particular. Therefore, this research aims to establish an analytic framework for evaluating, selecting DR sites for academic Big Data. The proposed analytic framework is consisting of the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), DEMATEL-based network process (DNP) and VIsekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) methods. An empirical study based on a real Big Data DR application of an Asian high-performance computer center's evaluation and selection of DR sites for academic Big Data is used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed framework. The analytic results can serve as a foundation for information technology administrators' strategies to reduce the performance gaps of a DR site for Big Data manipulations in general, and academic Big Data manipulations in special."
Learning analytics as assemblage: Criticality and contingency in online education,Learning analytics; big data; assemblage theory; online learning; critical education; higher education,,"Recently, the possibilities for leveraging big data in research and pedagogy have given rise to the growing field of learning analytics in online education. While much of this work has focused on quantitative metrics, some have called for critical perspectives that interrogate such data as an interplay between technical infrastructures and contingent social practices. Following such calls, this article conceptualizes learning analytics as an assemblage of technical, designed, and sociocognitive dimensions. Drawing on DeLanda's articulation of assemblage theory, we examine the ways online learning unfolds within and across these scales by using illustrative quantitative and qualitative data-click-data, user-generated content, and student interviews-from three online higher education courses. We consider how insights generated from such a stance might contribute to critical perspectives on how power circulates in online learning environments-a framework we call critical learning analytics. We conclude by offering some possibilities for which such a framework might be put to use-not only to map learning analytics as assemblage, but also to imagine how they might be assembled otherwise to promote more ethical instruction and more equitable student flourishing."

A generic model for the context-aware representation and federation of educational datasets: Experience from the dataTEL challenge,Knowledge modelling; Context metadata; Knowledge management; Learning analytics,ANALYTICS; SYSTEM,"Research on online interactions during a learning situation to better understand users' practices and to provide them with quality-oriented features, resources and services is attracting a large community. As a result, the interest for sharing educational data sets that translate the interactions of users with e-learning systems has become a hot topic today. However, the current systems aggregating social and usage data about their users suffer from a series of weaknesses. In particular, they lack a common information model that would allow for exchanges of interaction data at a large scale. To tackle this issue, we propose in this paper a generic model able to federate heterogeneous context metadata and to facilitate their share and reuse. This framework has been successfully applied to several data sets provided by the research community, and thus gives access to a big data set that could help researchers to increase efficiency of existing learning analytics technics, and promote research and development of new algorithms and services on top of these data."
Disrupting and democratising higher education provision or entrenching academic elitism: towards a model of MOOCs adoption at African universities,MOOCs; Disruptive innovation theory; Democratisation; Academic elitism,,"Challenges of broadening access, escalating cost, maintaining desirable quality and enhancing meaningful learning experiences in African higher education (HE) have spurred debates on how to restructure higher education delivery to meet the diverse needs of heterogeneous learners and adapt pedagogical models to the educational realities of low-income African countries. In view of these complexities, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been advanced by Western Consortia, universities and online platform providers as panaceas for disrupting/transforming existing education models African universities. MOOCs have been touted as disruptive innovations with the potential to create new niche markets for HE courses, disrupt traditional models of instruction and content delivery and create new revenue streams for higher education. Yet academic elitism which manifests in the exclusive selection of top American universities to develop, host and deliver MOOCs, MOOC providers' use of university brand and reputation as benchmarks for charging recruitment fees on headhunters recruiting MOOC graduates and their complex business models involving the sale of students' big data (e.g. learning analytics) for profit seem to be inconsistent with claims about philanthropic and egalitarian drive of MOOCs. Drawing on disruptive innovation theory and a review of mainstream literature on MOOCs adoption in American and African tertiary sectors, this study argues that behind the MOOC rhetoric of disrupting and democratizing higher education lies the projection of top academic brands on the marketing pedestal, financial piggybacking on the hype and politics of academic exclusion."
The Structural Consequences of Big Data-Driven Education,big data; personalized learning; competency-based education; smart tutors; learning analytics; MOOCs,LEARNING ANALYTICS,"Educators and commenters who evaluate big data-driven learning environments focus on specific questions: whether automated education platforms improve learning outcomes, invade student privacy, and promote equality. This article puts aside separate unresolvedand perhaps unresolvableissues regarding the concrete effects of specific technologies. It instead examines how big data-driven tools alter the structure of schools' pedagogical decision-making, and, in doing so, change fundamental aspects of America's education enterprise. Technological mediation and data-driven decision-making have a particularly significant impact in learning environments because the education process primarily consists of dynamic information exchange. In this overview, I highlight three significant structural shifts that accompany school reliance on data-driven instructional platforms that perform core school functions: teaching, assessment, and credentialing. First, virtual learning environments create information technology infrastructures featuring constant data collection, continuous algorithmic assessment, and possibly infinite record retention. This undermines the traditional intellectual privacy and safety of classrooms. Second, these systems displace pedagogical decision-making from educators serving public interests to private, often for-profit, technology providers. They constrain teachers' academic autonomy, obscure student evaluation, and reduce parents' and students' ability to participate or challenge education decision-making. Third, big data-driven tools define what counts as education by mapping the concepts, creating the content, determining the metrics, and setting desired learning outcomes of instruction. These shifts cede important decision-making to private entities without public scrutiny or pedagogical examination. In contrast to the public and heated debates that accompany textbook choices, schools often adopt education technologies ad hoc. Given education's crucial impact on individual and collective success, educators and policymakers must consider the implications of data-driven education proactively and explicitly."
Beyond engagement analytics: which online mixed-data factors predict student learning outcomes?,ICT in higher education; Moodle engagement analytics; Big data analytics; Online undergraduate business course; Student learning performance; Grades,,"This mixed-method study focuses on online learning analytics, a research area of importance. Several important student attributes and their online activities are examined to identify what seems to work best to predict higher grades. The purpose is to explore the relationships between student grade and key learning engagement factors using a large sample from an online undergraduate business course at an accredited American university (n = 228). Recent studies have discounted the ability to predict student learning outcomes from big data analytics but a few significant indicators have been found by some researchers. Current studies tend to use quantitative factors in learning analytics to forecast outcomes. This study extends that work by testing the common quantitative predictors of learning outcome, but qualitative data is also examined to triangulate the evidence. Pre and post testing of information technology understanding is done at the beginning of the course. First quantitative data is collected, and depending on the hypothesis test results, qualitative data is collected and analyzed with text analytics to uncover patterns. Moodle engagement analytics indicators are tested as predictors in the model. Data is also taken from the Moodle system logs. Qualitative data is collected from student reflection essays. The result was a significant General Linear Model with four online interaction predictors that captured 77.5 % of grade variance in an undergraduate business course."
Applying learning analytics for improving students engagement and learning outcomes in an MOOCs enabled collaborative programming course,Learning analytics; self-regulated learning; MOOCs; collaborative programming; big data analytics,SELF-REGULATION; ENVIRONMENTS,"As information technology continues to evolve rapidly, programming skills become increasingly crucial. To be able to construct superb programming skills, the training must begin before college or even senior high school. However, when developing comprehensive training programmers, the learning and teaching processes must be considered. In order to improve the students' learning outcome and engagement in programming course, this study applied learning analytics into the proposed massive online open courses (MOOCs) enabled collaborative programming course. Through the proposed learning activity, instructors receive a monthly report that explains which students are at risk and in need of timely intervention. This study conducted an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed learning activity. Students in the experimental group received learning interventions from an instructor according to the result of learning analytics, and students in the control group received interventions according to the instructor's observation. The data for this study were collected over 10 weeks at a university in Taiwan. The result indicated that the proposed programming course with learning analytics improved students' learning outcomes and levels of engagement."
A Big Data and Learning Analytics Approach to Process-Level Feedback in Cognitive Simulations,,HEALTH-PROFESSIONS EDUCATION; RADIOGRAPH INTERPRETATION; DELIBERATE PRACTICE; VIRTUAL PATIENTS; EXPERTISE; MAMMOGRAPHY; ACQUISITION; PERFORMANCE; MEDICINE; CURVES,"Collecting and analyzing large amounts of process data for the purposes of education can be considered a big data/learning analytics (BD/ LA) approach to improving learning. However, in the education of health care professionals, the application of BD/LA is limited to date. The authors discuss the potential advantages of the BD/LA approach for the process of learning via cognitive simulations. Using the lens of a cognitive model of radiograph interpretation with four phases (orientation, searching/scanning, feature detection, and decision making), they reanalyzed process data from a cognitive simulation of pediatric ankle radiography where 46 practitioners from three expertise levels classified 234 cases online. To illustrate the big data component, they highlight the data available in a digital environment (time-stamped, click-level process data). Learning analytics were illustrated using algorithmic computer-enabled approaches to process-level feedback. For each phase, the authors were able to identify examples of potentially useful BD/LA measures. For orientation, the trackable behavior of re-reviewing the clinical history was associated with increased diagnostic accuracy. For searching/scanning, evidence of skipping views was associated with an increased false-negative rate. For feature detection, heat maps overlaid on the radiograph can provide a metacognitive visualization of common novice errors. For decision making, the measured influence of sequence effects can reflect susceptibility to bias, whereas computer-generated path maps can provide insights into learners' diagnostic strategies. In conclusion, the augmented collection and dynamic analysis of learning process data within a cognitive simulation can improve feedback and prompt more precise reflection on a novice clinician's skill development."
Integrating Privacy in Architecture Design of Student Information System for Big Data Analytics,educational data mining; big data analytics; data security and privacy; opinion mining; online community data mining; digital education; big data analytics archicture; cloud,,"Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an area of growing interest in academia with significant challenges and tremendous opportunities.

A BIG DATA ARCHITECTURE FOR LEARNING ANALYTICS IN HIGHER EDUCATION,learning analytics; big data; educational data mining,,"Data with high volume, velocity, variety and veracity brings the new experience curve of analytics. Big data in higher education comes from different sources that include blogs, social networks, student information systems, learning management systems, research, and other machine-generated data. Once the data is analysed it promises better student placement processes; more accurate enrolment forecasts, and early warning systems that identify and assist students at-risk of failing or dropping out. Big data is becoming a key to creating competitive advantages in higher education. Like with any organization, traditional data processing and analysis of structured and unstructured data using RDBMS and data warehousing no longer satisfy big data challenges. The lack of adequate conceptual architectures for big data tailored for institutions of higher education has led to many failures to produce meaningful, accessible, and timely information for decision making. Therefore, this calls for the development of conceptual architectures for big data in higher education. This paper presents an architecture for big data analytics in higher education."
"Small data, online learning and assessment practices in higher education: a case study of failure?",Future-oriented learning; learning analytics; professional learning; teaching excellence framework (TEF),PROFESSIONALISM; CRITICALITY,"In this paper, we present an in-depth case study of a single student who failed an online module which formed part of a master's programme in Professional Education and Leadership. We use this case study to examine assessment practices in higher education in the online environment. In taking this approach, we go against the current predilection for Big Data which has given rise to learning analytics', a data-intensive approach to monitoring learning. In particular, we draw attention to the model of the learner produced by learning analytics and to issues of dataveillance' in online learning. We also use the case to examine assessment in higher education more broadly, exploring the tensions between the requirements for certification and the need for learning. We conclude that assessment practices in higher education may have more to do with quality assurance' and regulatory frameworks than with enhancing the student experience' and inculcating the qualities that mark out higher education as an ethical project."
The Givenness of the Human Learning Experience and Its Incompatibility with Information Analytics,learning analytics; Rene Descartes; Jean-Luc Marion; philosophy of information,PERSPECTIVES,"The rise of learning analytics, the application of complex metrics developed to exploit the proliferation of Big Data' in educational work, raises important moral questions about the nature of what is measurable in education. Teachers, schools and nations are increasingly held to account based on metrics, exacerbating the tendency for fine-grained measurement of learning experiences. In this article, the origins of learning analytics ontology are explored, drawing upon core ideas in the philosophy of computing, such as the general definition of information and the information-theoretic account of knowledge. Drawing upon a reading of Descartes Meditatio II, which extends the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion into a pedagogy of intentionality, the article identifies a fundamental incompatibility between the subjective experience of learning and the information-theoretic account of knowledge. Human subjects experience and value their own information incommensurably with the ways in which computers measure and quantify information. The consequences of this finding for the design of online learning environments, and the necessary limitations of learning analytics and measurement are explored."
Recommender System for Big Data in Education,Educational data mining; recommender systems; big data analytics,,"With the advent of web based e-learning systems, a huge amount of educational data is getting generated. These massive data gave rise to Big data in educational sectors. Currently, big data analytics techniques are being used to analyze these educational data and generate different predictions and recommendations for students, teachers and schools. Recommendation systems are already very helpful in e-commerce, service industry and social networking sites. Recently recommendation systems are proved to be efficient for education sector as well. In this work we are using recommendation system for Big data in education. This work uses collaborative filtering based recommendation techniques to recommend elective courses to students, depending upon their grade points obtained in other subjects. We are using item based recommendation of Mahout machine learning library on top of Hadoop to generate set of recommendations. Similarity Log-likelihood is used to discover patterns among grades and subjects. Root Mean Square Error between actual grade and recommended grade is used to test the recommendation system. The output of this study can be used by schools, colleges or universities to suggest alternative elective courses to students."
Implementation of Learning Analytics Framework for MOOCs using State-of-the-art In-Memory Computing,MOOCs; Learning Analytics; Apache Spark; Drop-out Prediction; Logistic Regression; Gradient Boosting; Random Forest; Stacked Ensemble,,"MOOC aims at delivering online courses to tens of thousands to millions of heterogeneous learners at the same time, with minimal or no charge. It provides an alternate way to disseminate quality education to the section of people who cannot reach premier institutions. It has great potential to overcome the barriers of traditional learning systems. However, there are several challenges in MOOCs such as huge drop-out rates, improper automated assessments, varied student engagement, and attention etc. Learning Analytics helps us to contain such issues. Learning analytics, with the help of Big Data Technologies, helps us to interpret humongous MOOCs data to assess progress, predict performance and identify problems. To perform analytics, we developed a workflow using Apache Spark, a scalable in-memory computing framework. The data from edX platform has been used for experiments. It contains the information of more than 2 Lakh students from 39 courses. Initially, detailed statistical analysis has been carried out to understand the learning patterns and the behavior of online learners. Later, we have developed drop-out prediction models using various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Logistic Regression. A stacked ensemble model is developed and performance comparison with baseline models is carried out. It outperformed all other models with an accuracy of 91.2%."

A Proposed Learner Activity Taxonomy and a Framework for Analysing Learner Engagement versus Performance using Big Educational Data,Learning Analytics; Big Data; learner engagement; online learning analysis; activity data; paradata,STUDENT ENGAGEMENT,"The inclusion of information and communication technologies in Healthcare and Medical Education is a fact nowadays. Furthermore numerous virtual learning environments have been established in order to host both educational material and learner's online activities. Online modules in a VLE can be designed in very different ways being part of different types of courses, while different models can be used to design the course based on what the creator aims to achieve. Thus, the types and the importance of the different elements of the online course may vary a lot. At the same time the need of a global approach to gather big educational data in order to provide valid meaning to the data through learning analytics and educational data mining is urgent. In order this to be achievable we propose a Learner Activity Taxonomy in which the different elements of the learners activity data can be categorised and a Learner Engagement Framework in which the importance of the different elements is vital in order for an analysis of the big educational data to provide a meaningful result. The initial application to practice of the Taxonomy and the Framework are presented based on data from 3 modules at 2 Universities, while the impact of them along with its limitations are discussed."
Representationalism at work: dashboards and data analytics in urban education,Data visualization; data analytics; visual analytics; Big Data; Representationalism; urban education,LEARNING ANALYTICS; BIG DATA,"This paper explores data analytics applied to urban education, focusing in particular on issues of representationalism, the view that representations (here, digital data) stand in mimetic relation to some external reality from which they are ontologically distinct. Based on interviews conducted over the 2016-2017 school year with a team of data professionals employed by a Charter Management Organization (CMO) that operates one dozen schools in South and East Los Angeles, this paper shows that respondents endorse a range of views about how data can stand in for things, events, and people. Data professionals charged with the creation and management of student-level data expressed views consistent with a representationalist understanding of digital data; by contrast, those charged chiefly with aggregating and analyzing heterogeneous streams of data expressed greater skepticism toward representationalist commitments. Despite this heterogeneous set of views, all of the data professionals interviewed relied on the same medium to communicate their interpretations of data to other members of the organization, including school personnel: a bespoke platform that consists of 125 dashboards. Critically, graphical means of visualization expressed objectivity, certainty, and actuarial foresight, even in cases where data professionals expressed ambivalence about the representational power of a given source of data."

All the processing stages of this model will be introduced in an algorithm that results in the production of learning actor knowledge tree."
"ACTIVITY, LEARNING OR DATA FETISHISM: ON LEARNER ANALYTICS, HIGHER EDUCATION AND REGIMES OF THOUGHT",learning analytics; learning management system; data,,"This paper problematises a pervasive discourse around learning analytics as a hegemonic regime of thought (Foucault, 1980, p. 81), offering a  local character of criticism (p. 81) to disrupt this discourse. My criticism has the following foci: obsession with learning management data, little analogous data being available for face-to-face teaching, and the undervaluing of academic analytics compared to learning analytics. Policy and practice shifts based on the  big data disaggregated from LMS and related platforms-a poor indication of teaching and learning activity in most university courses, which are taught face-to-face-creates rather than mitigates risk for university institutes."
Predictive Analytics for E Learning System,E-Learning; Educational Data Mining; Predictive Analytics; Decision Tree; Big Data,,"E Learning courses are much in demand in recent times. The need to study student's performance and predicting their performance is increasing along with it. With the growing popularity of educational technology, various data mining algorithms suitable for predicting student performance have been reviewed. The best algorithm depends on the nature of prediction the faculty wants to make. As the amount of student data is increasing the need to address the complexities of data relation and their processing is a challenge to find the student at risk of failing. This paper covers the Decision Tree Approach for Predictive Analytics of student's performance and its Big Data Implication."
IoTs for Capturing and Mastering Massive Data Online Learning Courses,Internet of Things (IoT); ICT; Sensors; IoE; Big data Mining; Data-driven decision making; e-learning,,"The rapid growth of educational data mining (EDM) is an emerging field in the academic world of research and studies focusing on collection, archiving, and analysis of data related to delivery methodology, quality of materials and student learning and assessment. The information analyzed informs the learning institution on how to improve learning experiences and how to run the institutional effectively. This paper explores the value of the Internet of Things (IoTs) in capturing and mastering massive data for online courses to assess and identify typical learning scenarios for learners. We hope this would be a useful instrumental tool to the range of approaches in education institutions to help their struggling learners to succeed in the academic field."

And then the feature of the students' study behavior are analyzed, based on the analysis the factors that affect the students' log in and resources explore behavior are acquired by the decision tree algorithm. According to the analysis the education workers can adjust and optimize the teaching strategies, improve the teaching process and the curriculum development, and then to organize the teaching content and build teaching mode according to the student's study behavior."
Learning analytics: challenges and limitations,Learning analytics; Big Data; sociomaterial; professional learning,EDUCATION GOVERNANCE; RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS; NUMBERS,"Learning analytic implementations are increasingly being included in learning management systems in higher education. We lay out some concerns with the way learning analytics - both data and algorithms - are often presented within an unproblematized Big Data discourse. We describe some potential problems with the often implicit assumptions about learning and learners - and indeed the tendency not to theorize learning explicitly - that underpin such implementations. Finally, we describe an attempt to devise our own analytics, grounded in a sociomaterial conception of learning. We use the data obtained to suggest that the relationships between learning and the digital traces left by participants in online learning are far from trivial, and that any analytics that relies on these as proxies for learning tends towards a behaviorist evaluation of learning processes."
Emerging Trends in Applications of Big Data in Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics,Educational Data Mining; Learning Analytics; Big Data; Prediction,,"In the last couple of years, the use of various applications of Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics has increased. Now a days, students have started using Internet to study. Due to the easy availability of online courses, student online activities have considerably increased which in turn has generated huge amount of data. These data gets wasted as conventional learning methods are not equipped for preparing it. Now, due to this, the Big Data technology has entered in the education field, to mine those huge chunks of datasets. This paper discusses the latest tools and technologies of Big Data in the field of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining."
Using big data to guide implementation of a web and mobile adaptive learning platform for medical students,,SPACED-EDUCATION; NATIONAL-BOARD; UNIFIED THEORY; TECHNOLOGIES; ACCEPTANCE; MOTIVATION,"Background: Adaptive learning platforms (ALPs) can revolutionize medical education by making learning more efficient, but their potential has not been realized because students do not use them persistently.Methods: We applied educational data mining methods to study United States medical students who used an ALP called Osmosis (www.osmosis.org) from 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015. Multivariate logistic regressions modeled persistence on Osmosis as the dependent variable and Osmosis-collected variables as predictors.Results: The 6787 students included in our analysis responded to a total of 887,193 items, with 2138 (31.5%) using Osmosis persistently. Number of items per student, mobile device use, subscription payment, and group membership were independently associated with persisting (p<0.001 in all models). Persistent users rated quality more favorably (p<0.01) but were not more confident in answer selections (p=0.80). While persisters were more accurate than non-persisters (55% (SD 18%) vs 52% (SD 22%), p<0.001), after adjusting for number of items, lower accuracy was associated with persistent use (OR 0.93 [95% CI 0.90-0.97], p<0.01).Conclusions: Our study of a large sample of U.S. medical students illustrates big data medical education research and provides guidance for improving implementation of ALPs and further investigation."
The logic of data-sense: thinking through Learning Personalisation,Big data; learning analytics; Deleuze; learning; personalisation,EDUCATION POLICY,"Big Data and Learning Analytics' promise to revolutionise educational institutions, endeavours, and actions through more and better data is now compelling. Multiple, and continually updating, data sets produce a new sense of personalised learning'. A crucial attribute of the datafication, and subsequent profiling, of learner behaviour and engagement is the continual modification of the learning environment to induce greater levels of investment on the parts of each learner. The assumption is that more and better data, gathered faster and fed into ever-updating algorithms, provide more complete tools to understand, and therefore improve, learning experiences through adaptive personalisation. The argument in this paper is that Learning Personalisation names a new logistics of investment as the common sense' of the school, in which disciplinary education is both disappearing and giving way to frightful continual training, to continual monitoring'."
A Novel Approach for Analyzing Student Interaction with Educational Systems,educational data mining; learning analytics; network traffic analysis; fog computing,BIG DATA,"The data in higher educational institutions come from the interaction of students with the various online systems, such as learning management, registration, advising and email. Research in the field of educational data mining is concerned with the collection and analysis of such data to discover new insights about student behavior, learning style and success factors. Since different departments in an institution manage different IT systems, collecting data from all of these departments requires collaboration. The data has to be extracted from many systems, which uses different data formats. Therefore, a typical research work in this field analyzes data extracted from one system. This paper, on the other hand, analyzes the network traffic that students generate while on campus. This approach provides us with a better view of the student interaction with the educational systems, compared to the single view achieved by analyzing data from one system. We anonymize student personally identifiable information to protect student privacy. Further, we propose the use of fog computing to enhance student privacy and reduce network load."
Educational Big Data Mining: How to Enhance Virtual Learning Environments,Big Data; Educational data mining; e-learning; Virtual Learning Environment,,"The growing development of virtual learning platforms is boosting a new type of Big Data and of Big Data Stream, those ones that can be labeled as e-learning Big Data. These data, coming from different sources of Virtual Learning Environments, such as communications between students and instructors as well as pupils tests, require accurate analysis and mining techniques in order to retrieve from them fruitful insights. This paper analyzes the main features of current e-learning systems, pointing out their sources of data and the huge amount of information that may be retrieved from them. Moreover, we assess the concept of educational Big Data, suggesting a logical and functional layered model that can turn to be very useful in real life."
How learning analytics can early predict under-achieving students in a blended medical education course,,ONLINE COURSES; BIG DATA; PERFORMANCE; SUCCESS,"Aim: Learning analytics (LA) is an emerging discipline that aims at analyzing students' online data in order to improve the learning process and optimize learning environments. It has yet un-explored potential in the field of medical education, which can be particularly helpful in the early prediction and identification of under-achieving students. The aim of this study was to identify quantitative markers collected from students' online activities that may correlate with students' final performance and to investigate the possibility of predicting the potential risk of a student failing or dropping out of a course.Methods: This study included 133 students enrolled in a blended medical course where they were free to use the learning management system at their will. We extracted their online activity data using database queries and Moodle plugins. Data included logins, views, forums, time, formative assessment, and communications at different points of time. Five engagement indicators were also calculated which would reflect self-regulation and engagement. Students who scored below 5% over the passing mark were considered to be potentially at risk of under-achieving.Results: At the end of the course, we were able to predict the final grade with 63.5% accuracy, and identify 53.9% of at-risk students. Using a binary logistic model improved prediction to 80.8%. Using data recorded until the mid-course, prediction accuracy was 42.3%. The most important predictors were factors reflecting engagement of the students and the consistency of using the online resources.Conclusions: The analysis of students' online activities in a blended medical education course by means of LA techniques can help early predict underachieving students, and can be used as an early warning sign for timely intervention."
"Assessing collaborative learning: big data, analytics and university futures",Social learning analytics; situated learning; collaborative learning; authentic assessment,KNOWLEDGE,"Assessment in higher education has focused on the performance of individual students. This focus has been a practical as well as an epistemic one: methods of assessment are constrained by the technology of the day, and in the past they required the completion by individuals under controlled conditions of set-piece academic exercises. Recent advances in learning analytics, drawing upon vast sets of digitally stored student activity data, open new practical and epistemic possibilities for assessment, and carry the potential to transform higher education. It is becoming practicable to assess the individual and collective performance of team members working on complex projects that closely simulate the professional contexts that graduates will encounter. In addition to academic knowledge, this authentic assessment can include a diverse range of personal qualities and dispositions that are key to the computer-supported cooperative working of professionals in the knowledge economy. This paper explores the implications of such opportunities for the purpose and practices of assessment in higher education, as universities adapt their institutional missions to address twenty-first century needs. The paper concludes with a strong recommendation for university leaders to deploy analytics to support and evaluate the collaborative learning of students working in realistic contexts."
Combining event- and variable-centred approaches to institution-facing learning analytics at the unit of study level,Universities; Latin America; Data; e-Learning; Learning analytics; Educational administrative data processing,INVOLVEMENT; OUTCOMES; TIME,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of combining event-centred and variable-centred approaches when analysing big data for higher education institutions. It uses a large, university-wide data set to demonstrate the methodology for this analysis by using the case study method. It presents empirical findings about relationships between student behaviours in a learning management system (LMS) and the learning outcomes of students, and further explores these findings using process modelling techniques. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes a two-year study in a Chilean university, using big data from a LMS and from the central university database of student results and demographics. Descriptive statistics of LMS use in different years presents an overall picture of student use of the system. Process mining is described as an event-centred approach to give a deeper level of understanding of these findings. Findings - The study found evidence to support the idea that instructors do not strongly influence student use of an LMS. It replicates existing studies to show that higher-performing students use an LMS differently from the lower-performing students. It shows the value of combining variable-and event-centred approaches to learning analytics. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited by its institutional context, its two-year time frame and by its exploratory mode of investigation to create a case study. Practical implications - The paper is useful for institutions in developing a methodology for using big data from a LMS to make use of event-centred approaches. Originality/value - The paper is valuable in replicating and extending recent studies using event-centred approaches to analysis of learning data. The study here is on a larger scale than the existing studies (using a university-wide data set), in a novel context (Latin America), that provides a clear description for how and why the methodology should inform institutional approaches."

Early Detection of At-Risk Students Using Machine Learning Based on LMS Log Data,learning analytics; enrollment management; institutional research; detection of at-risk students; machine learning; LMS log data,,"Analytics in education has been received much attention over the past decade. It is necessary to maintain high retention rate in any institutions of higher education, therefore several attempts on the application of analytics have been done for this problem. To detect students at high drop-out risk early and intervene them effectively, utilizing the educational big data can be useful. In this paper, an automatic detection method of academically at-risk students by using log data of learning management systems is considered. Some well-known machine learning methods are used to build a predictive model of student performance evaluated by GPA. By using actual data set, we investigate an availability of the proposed method and discuss its ability to early detection of off-task behavior. The experimental results indicated that some characteristics of behavior about learning which affect the learning outcomes can be detected with only the online log data. Furthermore, comparative importance of explanatory variables obtained by the approach would help to estimate which variable affects comparatively to the learning outcome and it can be used in institutional research."
Data Consideration for At-risk Students Early Alert,Early alert; at-risk student; predictive model; learning analytics,,"In recent years, leveraging big data technology to education domain draws attention. The retention rate of student on campus may be significantly improved if an early alert system based on data analysis is setup and the intervention is appropriately deployed. However, to the best of our knowledge, the existing proposed early alert systems take the whole participants in a group or one single class as analysis target. In this paper, we compare different strategies and methods that deal with the whole participants and groups in different classes to identify the key attributes to improve the accuracy of the proposed early alert systems. Our results in this study indicate that teachers in different classes may make use of different functionality of LMS. Different data volumes are collected in different classes. A robust early alert predictive model needs to take the above into consideration."

The analysis and visualization methods of this study use association analysis with Apriori algorithm. Logs for e-book-based learning analytics were collected in an e-book system. In order to analyze and visualize the collected logs, this paper proposes a system called SILM (System for Improving Learning Materials). Using SILM, instructors or teachers can find the learning materials that should be improved. We believe that improving learning materials with analyzing and visualizing educational big data lead to improving student results."
Educational Data Mining Perspectives Within University Big Data Environment,Big Data; Educational Industry; Educational Data Mining,,"All organizations are working nowadays in a very dynamic and strongly competitive environment. In order to survive and remain competitive, they need to take timely, adequate and informed decisions that are based not only on intuition and past experience. The main challenges for data analysis are related with the specific characteristics of big data and the availability of suitable analytical tools for knowledge extraction that would support the processes of taking strategic management decisions. While big data are already widely available and used in business, there are only rare cases of utilizing big data in the educational sector. The main purpose of this paper is to focus on the challenges related to the analytical processing of  big data generated and stored at higher education institutions. The paper discusses the unique opportunities that Big Data analysis could give for the educational sector development and the improvements that could scale from a single school, to governmental directions and satisfaction of the labor market. However, big data analytics confronts universities with great challenges as well, related to finding appropriate methods and tools for extracting knowledge and patterns from extremely rich and complex data sets, and integrating the insights into a coherent vision for strategic management decisions."
USING LEARNING ANALYTICS TO INFORM THE PROCESS OF FORMATIVE FEEDBACK: INTERACTION AND INTERVENTION IN ONLINE AND BLENDED LEARNING COURSES,Learning analytics; formative; feedback; online learning; assessment; learner profiling,,"Over the last few years learning analytics has emerged as a significant area of investigation in relation to learner profiling, improving learning outcomes and identifying learners at risk of exclusion or failure. Given the emergence of big data from a business context much of the research on learning analytics to date has focused on quantitative studies and the potential of summative test data to predict learner behaviour in the future. Moreover, analytics has often been perceived as a tool for institutions, administrators or instructors to track learners rather than as a tool to empower learners or to inform sound pedagogy. This paper aims to critically examine the challenges and opportunities presented by learning analytics in the context of providing student feedback in online language learning where few studies have yet to emerge. The research arises from a two-year EU funded project called VITAL (Visualisation Tools and Analytics to Monitor Online Language Learning and Teaching) (2016-2017) and explores how analytics can be used to inform online formative feedback to undergraduates on a blended learning module on business communication (n=200) and taught postgraduate students on a fully online master's degree (n=20) at a university in the UK. Both modules had a duration of 12 weeks and were taught using the Blackboard course management system. In both cases learners engaged with a series of online discussion board tasks punctuated by instructor feedback. Extracting data from Blackboard via manual SQL queries provided data showing the sequence of learner engagement and the frequency of views for learning activities, remedial resources, and instructor feedback. In turn this enabled instructors to examine correlations in the data as a result of visualization on dashboards. Results suggest that analytics can be used in real-time to design and implement interventions in order to identify when unsuccessful students are not reading or engaging with instructor feedback. The implications of the study indicate that more research is required on analytics to examine how much time students spend on formative feedback and the implications for grade performance. The study is significant in that instructor feedback is frequently identified by students as an important aspect of their online learning process, but little research has been done to date to investigate to what extent and in what ways learners access feedback and spend sufficient time reading it."
LEARNING ANALYTICS TO CLASSIFY STUDENTS ACCORDING TO THEIR ACTIVITY IN MOODLE,Learning Analytics; Moodle; Data Mining; E-learning,,"In the last years, the use of Learning Analytics (LA) tools has been increasing to process the available information about students collected through different Learning Management Systems (LMS). In this study, we have analyzed the interactions in the educational scenario collected through Moodle (Modular Object Oriented Developmental Learning Environment), a leading open source LMS, in order to provide a classification of students by using clustering techniques, to improve the learning process. Students online activities generate large quantities of data that before were wasted since no LA tools were available to process them. With the irruption of the big data techniques in the educational sector, a lot of information can be easily treated to extract behaviors of the students and classify them according to their profiles. These analyses define models of action that help both the in-service teacher and the new teacher who joins the department. In addition, detailed analysis of this information may help us in the study of a possible relationship between different indicators of use of these platforms and the performance of students, both generated throughout the learning process as those coming from summative evaluation. In this study, we provide the construction of a data analysis model facilitated by the Moodle platform, from the different interactions between the teacher, the student and the developed subject; so that, this information can be transformed into knowledge and their understanding can help to the improvement of teaching practice. In particular, it addresses the application of these models to the improvement of the students' learning strategies according to their typology."

INNOVATIONS TO DESIGN PERSONALIZED LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR STEM EDUCATION OF THE FUTURE?,Personal learning environment; Learning analytics; pre-commercial procurement; STEM Education; Innovation,,"Emerge of new technologies such as mobile devices, social media, gamification and learning analytics using big data have opened up solutions to meet the increased demand of personalized learning in the 21st century European classroom (Fizgerald et al., 2013). Yet many challenges remain, particularly in topics of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)(Bybee, 2010). Students are unmotivated to head for STEM careers where professionals are increasingly needed (Harackiewicz et al., 2012). Future learning environments should be able to support personalized, tailored solutions for all students (Santos et al., 2014). Costs and risks of early school leavers are a global societal challenge, in which the emerge of new learning technologies, could have a direct impact upon. Technology-supported PLEs have been developed over the last few decades to increase students' motivation and support individual learning paths suitable for each student's learning styles (Felder & Spurlin, 2005) and preferences. Fast developing technologies propose a challenge also for teachers who lack both the time and the competences (Clements & Pawlowski, 2012) to make use of these technologies. In this research we first investigated the PLE state-of-the-art through literature review. We then tackled the question of what should the future's personal learning environments for STEM be like. Through a pre-commercial procurement (PCP) method we prepared PCP based on the literature review, as well as invitation to tender for which 11 complete PLE service offers were received. Those offers were then the evaluated and analyzed for the technical and pedagogical functionalities with a panel of teachers from four countries in Europe (Finland, Sweden, Germany and Spain) as well as three specifically chosen external experts (technical, pedagogical and STEM). 65-point criteria rising from the literature review was used for this. The analysis of the evaluation panel show that the state-of-the-art in PLEs is still far behind of more commercial fields such as retail industry or social media solutions. Smart use of learning analytics can solve many of these challenges. Users expect the system to read their minds and guide them to the support they need, whether it is learning style tailored content, or smart solutions for peer support within their own classrooms. Teachers should be able to evaluate entire classrooms of students within one dashboard. The current state-of-the-art in PLEs unfortunately uses very little of the possibilities learning analytics could provide: Often the systems tend to only measure user behavior instead of actual learning. Our findings also show that users should be involved early into the PLE design process and testing should be conducted in real classrooms. Overall the dialogue between demand and supply side throughout the development is the key to the PCP's success. The contribution of this study is a trend guideline for PLE stakeholders, which could be specifically be used in designing improved learning solutions. This work has been conducted in within European Union co-funded IMAILE project."
EMBEDDING LEARNING ANALYTICS IN TARGETED RETENTION PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE THE UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCE FOR COMMENCING STUDENTS,Enhance student engagement; improve student experience; retention and attrition,,"Student attrition from higher education is a problem worldwide. It signifies a personal loss to the individual; it carries a social and economic cost to the community; and it results in a significant financial cost to each university. While differences exist in the way universities have approached this issue, the literature shows the need for a holistic strategy that aims to facilitate and enhance student engagement with their institutions. Flinders University developed and implemented a centrally run program called the Student Success Program (SSP) to contact students who are likely to drop out in the first year of their enrolment. The aim of the SSP is to maximise retention and improve the student experience at Flinders University. The relevant literature and institutional experiences led to the consideration of all data sources, both static and dynamic, that are readily available for all students in scope. Predictions from machine learning models, built using big data, were utilised to target such students. At least three call-out campaigns per semester, which are consistent with the transition timeline of commencing students, were conducted each semester with each running for at least four weeks. About 14270 students were contacted by their peers over a period of three years to elicit information about their level of preparedness for their studies. The findings demonstrate reduced student attrition, improved appreciation and effective utilisation of student support services. Data analysis also shows that the SSP has saved directly a significant number of students and has contributed to the enhancement of the university experience for many more."
Traversing the Barriers to Using Big Data in Understating How High School Students Design,,INQUIRY; SCIENCE; COMPLEX,"The context of this paper is a large learner data project that seeks to respond to existing challenges by introducing educational data mining and learning analytics into K-12 engineering design research. To probe deeply into student learning, we are developing and refining computational techniques to analyze large process analytics datasets generated through a CAD-based software, Energy3D, that logs design process data as students complete an assigned design challenge, such as a net-zero energy efficient building. We are combining these process analytics with demographic data and pre/post-tests of science and design knowledge. In this paper, we revisit three illustrative research cases to reflect on our experiences and lessons learned with navigating big data, generating useful data visualizations, and integrating process analytics with traditional performance assessment methods to relate design actions to knowledge and learning outcomes."
Spatial-Data-Driven Student Characterization in Higher Education,Spatial data; Higher Education; Learning Analytics; Student Characterization,,"Higher Education is facing disruptive innovation that requires, among other things, provision of a more effective and customized education service to individual students. In the field of Learning Analytics (LA), there has been much effort, in the form of the collection and thorough analysis of a variety of student-related datasets, to optimize learning performance and environments by means of personalization. The datasets include traditional questionnaire surveys, learning management system (LMS) log data of learner activities, and, more recently in the wake of the big-data-analytics trend, unstructured datasets such as SNS activities, text data, and other transactional data. Spatial data, however, is rarely considered as a key dataset, despite its high potential for characterization of students and prediction of their performances and conditions. In this context, the authors propose a new, spatial-data-driven student-characterization research framework. This vision paper describes spatial computing in its three, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive modeling stages as well as its three challenges: (1) technical spatial data acquisition issues; (2) legal and administrative issues; (3) expansion of the application domains in which spatial data can contribute to improved modeling quality. With respect to each challenge, the on-going efforts are briefly introduced in order to substantiate the feasibility of the proposed research framework."

Review of eQETIC Model based on Academic Analytics,Distance Education; Digital Educational Solutions; Academic Analytics,,"The avalanche of data of many types generated at high speed proposes nowadays a new scenario nominated Big Data. These data generated by many types of systems, such as commercial systems, financial systems, and even systems involving areas such as healthcare and education need to be analyzed to favor decision making. In this sense, specific techniques and technologies can be used together to establish Analytics, a special term used for data analysis. Generally called Analytics, specifications such as Business Analytics, Learning Analytics, or Academic Analytics can be identified. In this way, this research addresses the relationship between the concepts of Academic Analytics and a specific model for the management and operation of digital solutions in the educational area called eQETIC. Analyzing the practices proposed by the model and the concepts, it is possible to identify, in a non-quantitative way, that the model favors the activities of data management and data analysis; consequently it is also favor the implementation of Academic Analytics."
Strategies for Data and Learning Analytics Informed National Education Policies: the Case of Uruguay,big data; Plan Ceibal; education policies; technology enhanced learning,,"This work provides an overview of an education and technology monitoring system developed at Plan Ceibal, a nationwide initiative created to enable technology enhanced learning in Uruguay. Plan Ceibal currently offers one-to-one access to technology and connectivity to every student and teacher (from primary and secondary education) as well as a comprehensive set of educational software platforms. All these resources generate massive amounts of data about the progress and style of students learning. This work introduces the conceptual framework, design and preliminary results of the Big Data Center for learning analytics currently being developed at Plan Ceibal. This initiative is focused on exploiting these datasets and conducting advanced analytics to support the educational system. To this aim, a 360 degrees profile will be built including information characterizing the user's online behavior as well as a set of technology enhanced learning factors. These profiles will be studied both at user (e.g., student or teacher) and larger scale levels (e.g., per school or school system), addressing both the need of understanding how technology is being used for learning as well as to provide accurate feedback to support evidence based educational policies."
Quasi-Experimental Design for Causal Inference Using Python and Apache Spark: A Hands-on Tutorial,Causal inference; big data; parallel computing; python; quasi-experiment design; Apache Spark,PROPENSITY SCORE,"Educational practitioners and policy makers require evidence supporting claims about educational efficacy. Evidence is often found using causal relationships between education inputs and student learning outcomes. Causal inference covers a wide range of topics in education research, including efficacy studies to prove if a new policy, software, curriculum or intervention is effective in improving student learning outcomes. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are considered a gold standard method to demonstrate causality. However, these studies are expensive, timely and costly, as well as not being ethical to conduct in many educational contexts. Causality can also be deducted purely from observational data. In this tutorial, we will review methodologies for estimating the causal effects of education inputs on student learning outcomes using observational data. This is an inherently complex task due to many hidden variables and their interrelationships in educational research. In this tutorial, we discuss causal inference in the context of educational research with big data. This is the first tutorial of its kind at Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK) that provides a hands-on experience with Python and Apache Spark as a practical tool for educational researchers to conduct causal inference. As a prerequisite, attendees are required to have familiarity with Python."

Student Attitudes toward Learning Analytics in Higher Education: The Fitbit Version of the Learning World,learning analytics; higher education; student attitudes; dashboards; big data,BIG DATA; PRIVACY,"Increasingly, higher education institutions are exploring the potential of learning analytics to predict student retention, understand learning behaviors, and improve student learning through providing personalized feedback and support. The technical development of learning analytics has outpaced consideration of ethical issues surrounding their use. Of particular concern is the absence of the student voice in decision-making about learning analytics. We explored higher education students' knowledge, attitudes, and concerns about big data and learning analytics through four focus groups (N = 41). Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts identified six key themes. The first theme, Uninformed and Uncertain, represents students' lack of knowledge about learning analytics prior to the focus groups. Following the provision of information, viewing of videos and discussion of learning analytics scenarios three further themes: Help or Hindrance to Learning, More than a Number, and Impeding Independence; represented students' perceptions of the likely impact of learning analytics on their learning. Driving Inequality and Where Will it Stop? represent ethical concerns raised by the students about the potential for inequity, bias and invasion of privacy and the need for informed consent. A key tension to emerge was how personal vs. collective purposes or principles can intersect with uniform vs. autonomous activity. The findings highlight the need the need to engage students in the decision making process about learning analytics."
Ethical Considerations in the Practical Application of the Unisa Socio-Critical Model of Student Success,learning analytics; academic analytics; algocracy; higher education,,"The prediction and classification of student performance has always been a central concern within higher education institutions. It is therefore natural for higher education institutions to harvest and analyse student data to inform decisions on education provision in resource constrained South African environments. One of the drivers for the use of learning and academic analytics is the pressures for greater accountability in the areas of improved learning outcomes and student success. Added to this is the pressure on local government to produce well-educated populace to participate in the economy. The counter discourse in the field of big data cautions against algocracy where algorithms takeover the human process of democratic decision making. Proponents of this view argue that we run the risk of creating institutions that are beholden to algorithms predicting student success but are unsure of how they work and are too afraid to ignore their guidance. This paper aims to discuss the ethics, values, and moral arguments revolving the use of big data using a practical demonstration of learning analytics applied at Unisa."
Role of personality in computer based learning,Computer based learning; Edutainment; Personality models; learner's personality; Intelligent tutoring systems; Adaptive learning,ACHIEVEMENT; STUDENTS; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; INSTRUCTION; TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN; SYSTEM; STYLE; GAME,"With the rapid growth of technology enhanced learning, new mediums for learning have emerged. One of these mediums is computer based learning where the main concern is how to design a computer based learning system which takes into consideration the learners' differences. Personality is considered as one of the most critical sources of individual differences. This study investigates how personality differences-within learners can affect computer based learning, through a comprehensive review of the literature. The highlighted results from the obtained nineteen studies are: (a) the most referred to personality model in computer based learning is MBTI; (b) personality traits affect how learners prefer learning content and learning approach like collecting information, communicating with instructor and peer, study behavior, acting and performing; (c) a new model of personality variables should be considered in computer based learning by taking all interested researchers and practitioners into accounts; and (d) the traditional questionnaire approach which is still the pre-dominant method to identify the learner's personality; and this needs to be changed with new potential of big data and learning analytics. Furthermore, this study presents a new implicit approach using learning analytics instead of questionnaire-based approach to identify the learner's personality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

CERTAIN INVESTIGATIONS ON BIG DATA APPROACHES IN EDUCATION AND LEARNING ANALYTICS,Big Data; Business intelligence (BI); Data warehouse; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Visualization-based data discovery,,"The applications of computerized tools for learning management systems in education have been increasing in the last few years. Online contents by means of mobile phones, primarily smart phones enable the students to keep the learning processes around the clock. The enormous amount of data captured from student's online activities is wasted as traditional learning analytics are not capable of processing them. So in this paper it is proposed to use Big Data technologies and tools into education for capturing learning process of students, strategic operational decisions at institutions. The computing platform and teaching methods to accommodate emerging technologies for related courses are also investigated in this paper. In addition, visualization-based data discovery tools are focused on the front end of big data on helping institutions explore the data more easily and understand it more fully."
Learning Opportunities for Mass Collaboration Projects Through Learning Analytics: a Case Study,Active learning; Big data; collaborative projects; learning analytics; MOOC,WIKI; SOCIOMETRY; SCIENCE,"One way to improve the education of our students is to promote the creation of mass collaborative projects. These projects, also seen as learning products, would also help to better scale our learning experiences (massive open online courses) and generate collective value from the hours and cognitive efforts invested doing academic work. However, the complexities to assess those projects are challenging. This requires developing new monitoring and feedback systems for this kind of projects. This paper presents an exploratory analysis for applying learning analytics methodologies based on social networks analysis, factorial analysis, k-means clustering, and naive Bayes algorithms."
Digital analytics in professional work and learning,Digital analytics; professional practice; learning; algorithms; big data; software,HIDDEN CURRICULUM; TECHNOLOGY,"In a wide range of fields, professional practice is being transformed by the increasing influence of digital analytics: the massive volumes of big data, and software algorithms that are collecting, comparing and calculating that data to make predictions and even decisions. Researchers in a number of social sciences have been calling attention to the far-reaching and accelerating consequences of these forces, claiming that many professionals, researchers, policy-makers and the public are just beginning to realise the enormous potentials and challenges these analytics are producing. Yet, outside of particular areas of research and practice, such as learning analytics, there has been little discussion of this to date in the broader education literature. This article aims to set out some key issues particularly relevant to the understandings of professional practice, knowledge and learning posed by the linkages of big data and software code. It begins by outlining definitions, forms and examples of these analytics, their potentialities and some of the hidden impact, and then presents issues for researchers and educators. It seeks to contribute to and extend debates taking place in certain quarters to a broader professional education and work audience."

Specifically, this article first introduces big data, followed by delineating the potential opportunities of using big data in education in two areas: learning analytics and educational policy. Then, the concerns over data security, privacy protection, and ethical boundaries of accessing personal digital data are discussed. The article concludes with an invitation to education practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to advance our understanding of big data and better serve students in the digital era."
The Evolution of Research on Digital Education,MOOCs; Digital Education; Learning Analytics,,"How does AI&EdAIED today compare to 25 years ago? This paper addresses this evolution by identifying six trends. The trends are ongoing and will influence learning technologies going forward. First, the physicality of interactions and the physical space of the learner became genuine components of digital education. The frontier between the digital and the physical has faded out. Similarly, the opposition between individual and social views on cognition has been subsumed by integrated learning scenarios, which means that AIED pays more attention today to social interactions than it did at its outset. Another trend is the processing of learners' behavioural particles, which do not carry very many semantics when considered individually, but are predictive of knowledge states when large data sets are processed with machine learning methods. The development of probabilistic models and the integration of crowdsourcing methods has produced another trend: the design of learning environments has become less deterministic than before. The notion of learning environment evolved from a rather closed box to an open ecosystem in which multiple components are distributed over multiple platforms and where multiple stakeholders interact. Among these stakeholders, it is important to notice that teachers play a more important role than before: they interact not only at the design phase (authoring) but also in the runtime phase (orchestration). These trends are not specific to AIED; they depict the evolution of learning technologies as a whole."
"Rethinking assessment in a digital age: opportunities, challenges and risks",formative; summative; e-assessment; collaboration; learning analytics; ethics; inclusion; digital literacies,HIGHER-EDUCATION; TECHNOLOGY; RESISTANCE; FEEDBACK; STUDENTS,"While it is frequently argued that assessment sits at the heart of the learning process, in practice assessment often remains narrowly focused on qualifications and reporting achievements, driven by institutional and societal aspirations and tensions such as accountability and economic well being. Yet, the need for assessment to account for the knowledge, skills, dispositions and attitudes necessary to equip young people for a changing and increasingly digital world is also increasingly acknowledged. Based on our recent research review, this article critically examines the role of technology enhanced assessment (or TEA). We argue that while technology offers many potentially creative opportunities for innovation and for rethinking assessment purposes, there are also numerous risks and challenges. In particular we highlight ethical concerns over social exclusion and new forms of digital dividedness and the increasing risks associated with big data and the rise of learning analytics. Finally, we note that much research and innovation happens in silos, where policy, research and practice on assessment, technology enhanced assessment and ethical and political concerns are not linked up. We conclude that there needs to be a much more wide-ranging, critical and nuanced discussion in educational and policy circles so that debates about the potential of technology can be linked to improving assessment in the light of the range of social and political challenges that such progress presents. We end with some critical questions for policy, practice and research communities, which we offer as a starting point for future thinking and ways forward."
Student privacy in learning analytics: An information ethics perspective,information privacy; Autonomy; higher education; information ethics; learning analytics; student privacy,EDUCATION,"Higher education institutions have started using big data analytics tools. By gathering information about students as they navigate information systems, learning analytics employs techniques to understand student behaviors and to improve instructional, curricular, and support resources and learning environments. However, learning analytics presents important moral and policy issues surrounding student privacy. We argue that there are five crucial questions about student privacy that we must address in order to ensure that whatever the laudable goals and gains of learning analytics, they are commensurate with respecting students' privacy and associated rights, including (but not limited to) autonomy interests. We address information access concerns, the intrusive nature of information-gathering practices, whether or not learning analytics is justified given the potential distribution of consequences and benefits, and issues related to student autonomy. Finally, we question whether learning analytics advances the aims of higher education or runs counter to those goals."
"Digital education governance: data visualization, predictive analytics, and 'real-time' policy instruments",big data; database; governance; infrastructure; policy instruments; predictive analytics; visualization,BIG DATA; ALGORITHMIC POWER; DATAVEILLANCE; DATABASES; NETWORKS; PARADIGM; SOFTWARE,"Educational institutions and governing practices are increasingly augmented with digital database technologies that function as new kinds of policy instruments. This article surveys and maps the landscape of digital policy instrumentation in education and provides two detailed case studies of new digital data systems. The Learning Curve is a massive online data bank, produced by Pearson Education, which deploys highly sophisticated digital interactive data visualizations to construct knowledge about education systems. The second case considers learning analytics' platforms that enable the tracking and predicting of students' performances through their digital data traces. These digital policy instruments are evidence of how digital database instruments and infrastructures are now at the centre of efforts to know, govern and manage education both nationally and globally. The governing of education, augmented by techniques of digital education governance, is being distributed and displaced to new digitized centres of calculation', such as Pearson and Knewton, with the technical expertise to calculate and visualize the data, plus the predictive analytics capacities to anticipate and pre-empt educational futures. As part of a data-driven style of governing, these emerging digital policy instruments prefigure the emergence of real-time' and future-tense' techniques of digital education governance."
MODELING THE HUMANITIES: DATA LESSONS FROM THE WORLD OF EDUCATION,educational data modeling; learning analytics; computational analysis; 'big' data; human-machine patterning,,"This article will explore advances in the field of educational data modeling that have implications for modeling humanistic data. Traditional humanistic inquiry, bolstered by micro-analyses conducted by the scholar, has made way for machine-assisted methods that parse and quantify large amounts of qualitative data to reveal possible trends and focus more analogue approaches. At best, this play between human-and machine-directed approaches can lead to more profound explorations of texts. In this exploration of qualitative-quantitative methodologies that leverage human agency and machine-directed techniques, I suggest a mixed methods approach for dealing with the humanities. Specifically, this discussion will analyze the current methodological tensions related to Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics to reveal best practices for modeling humanistic data. Principle questions of interest in this essay include: What defines literary big data? How can we define DH modeling and where does it depart from traditional data modeling? What role does machine-based modeling have in the context of the scholarly close read? What can we learn from educational data modeling practices that are in the midst of resolving tensions between human-machine patterning?"
Big Data & eLearning: A Binomial to the Future of the Knowledge Society,Big Data; Distance learning; Educational technology; Learning analytics,,"There is no doubt that in what refers to the educational area, technology is producing a series of changes that will greatly affect our near future. The increase of students experiences in the new educational systems in distance learning makes possible to have information related to the students 'activities and how these can be dealt with automatic procedures. The implementation of these analytical methods is possible through the use of powerful new technologies such as Data Mining or Big Data. Relevant information is obtained of the use made by the students of the technological tools in a Learning Management System, thus, allowing us to infer a pattern of behavior of the students, to be used in the future."
Regulating big data education in Europe: lessons learned from the US,Education; Learning analytics; Student data; Big data,PRIVACY,"European schools are increasingly relying on vendors to collect, process, analyse, and even make decisions based on a considerable amount of student data through big data tools and methods. Consequently, portions of school's power are gradually shifting from traditional public schools to the hands of for-profit organisations. This article discusses the current and forthcoming European Union (EU) data protection regime with respect to the protection of student rights from the potential risk of outsourcing student data utilisation in Kindergarten-12th grade (K-12) educational systems. The article identifies what lessons can be drawn from recent developments in the United States (US) student data affair. These lessons can provide a new perspective for designing a balanced policy for regulating the shift in school's power."
DESIGN OF HYBRID LABS IN ENGINEERING: A PROPOSAL FOR STEM LEARNING,Hybrid labs in engineering; Technology Acceptance Model TAM; STEM,EDUCATION; ENGAGEMENT; REMOTE,"The purpose of this paper is to detail a methodology for designing hybrid laboratories (HL) in manufacturing engineering. The proposed methodology includes physic and logic layers and also the HL management in its different modes of operation. The design takes into account the role of actors in learning science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Finally, a first learning experience involving students from the University of Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM) of Spain and EAN of Colombia will be detailed. Different pedagogical models coincide on the importance of using laboratories for training in STEM according to the new training needs. However, the main issue consists in using the same lab on different leaning environments (e.g. face to face or blended learning) simultaneously. The idea of combining conventional education equipment with simulation software, and remotely access platforms supported by ICTs (information and communications technology) is a solution that allows the development of hybrid laboratories, taking the advantages of each type of laboratory, integrating equipment and generating synergies. In addition, HL offers the possibility of including emerging technologies (augmented reality, sensor networks, haptic, virtualization, tele-presence, tele-sensing, Big data, IoT, Avatars) for improving learning techniques. This challenge requires efforts on: Technics: The HL must be non-intrusive, guaranteeing equipment integrity, using self-machine software, plug and play technology, and developing replicable and low-cost modules. Pedagogy: In order to integrate it into the learning management system, supporting new methodologies (custom and open learning, flipped classroom), making learning assessment models (learning analytics) or data mining to feedback the results and improve the methodology. Social: The approach should be transdisciplinary and multi-user. It should allow the inclusion of networks or collaborative working. It also should benefit the development of cluster of Labs, sharing learning resources and equipment between institutions. The design has followed guidelines such as: IEEE P1484.1 / D9, and IEEE P1876 (Preliminary) that focus on the structure and components of learning environments. We propose using a methodology based on Engineering design tools that complies with the expectations of education for STEM in all its forms, overcomes the proposed challenges and complies with regulations. The HL design employs techniques and design methodologies in order to integrate a functional model (logic, physics and management). The followed steps are: Requirements: The role of actors, pedagogical models applied to STEM, and relevant regulations were analyzed. Architecture & prototyping: A basic prototype of HL for teaching CNC machining process was designed and built. The experimental module (SMART) was applied to 2 undergraduate courses; on-site (UCLM, Spain) and virtual (EAN University, Colombia). Evolution: Some recommendations for increasing scalability and flexibility were established."
Early-stage Engagement: Applying Big Data Analytics on Collaborative Learning Environment for Measuring Learners Engagement Rate,Computer-supported Collaborative Learning; Learning Analytics; Collaborative Programming; Clickstream Data; Big-Data Analysis,SYSTEM; EFFICACY; SUPPORT,"Computer-supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is a pedagogical strategy associated with how learners construct knowledge with a group by computer-based learning system. In recent years, most of the computer-based learning systems record the interaction log of each learner when developing course assignments. However, the recorded data is facing a challenge to expose the learners behaviors during the course and to design a computer-supported collaborative learning activity. To address those challenges in this paper, a novel collaborative programming tool called Software Project Development and Insight Learning Environment (SPDI Learning Environment) is described. The SPDI Learning Environment allows learners of computer science to develop course assignments collaboratively. Besides, it allows instructors to investigate the learners behaviors by associating a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) with Big Data analysis pipeline and Visualization Dashboard. In addition to collect real data from courses, we designed learning activities to help teachers to engage the field of CSCL and Learning Analytics."

Implementing Machine Learning on a big Data Engine for e-Learning,eLearning analytics; big learning data; eLearning data mining; apache Spark; education,,"Due to high volume, velocity, and variety (referred to as 3V) of data production, the term big data has recently emerged. Because of such fast data growth, Data centers of educational institutions are seemingly exploding as well. Therefore, big data is making its way to the field of E-learning. Nowadays large educational institutions feel the urgent need to analyze this flood of data to provide students with higher quality of services. Despite the fact that there is huge volume and variety of data with high velocity of production, the existing traditional methods are unable to analyze such data. In other words, there is little done on implementing learning analytics on big data engines. The author created a scalable machine learning system on a cluster of three machines suitable for large dataset operations using big data engine and implemented an early warning process with machine learning techniques. The dataset was obtained from online and semionline courses from The University of Tehran. Many features like access time, history of access and history of actions of students were extracted and used for the classification task. A parallel distributed classification process was run to predict students' success and failures. It offers a fast, scalable and in-memory process with apache Spark. Eventually, the research compares the efficiency of proposed method with current and common methods'. The results reveal that our model had a high classification accuracy and the larger the dataset, the more efficient our process will be. It also discusses a new term learning analytic and big data that are completely new and worth reading. My paper contains worthy information about implementing ELearning data mining on big data engines."
Towards a Big Data Architecture for Facilitating Cyber Threat Intelligence,Big data architecture; Hadoop; Cyber security; Machine learning; Predictive analytics,,"Internet and organizational network security is still threatened by devastating malicious activities. Given the continuous escalation of such attacks in terms of their frequency, sophistication and stealthiness, it is of paramount importance to generate effective cyber threat intelligence that aim at inferring, attributing, characterizing and mitigating such misdemeanors. Nevertheless, such imperative tasks are partially impeded by the lack of approaches that can produce prompt and accurate actionable intelligence by investigating various network traffic sources. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a big data architecture that is rooted in real-time network traffic processing, distributed messaging and scalable data storage. The key benefit of the proposed architecture is that it automates the aggregation and transformations of heterogeneous network data, allowing for greater focus on cyber threat intelligence analytics, rather than data management, aggregation, reconciliation and formatting. Empirical evaluations investigating the application of machine learning analytics by exploiting the artifacts resulting from a prototype of the proposed architecture and by using 100 GB of real network traffic, indeed demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and added-value of the proposed architecture."

RELATIONS BETWEEN LEARNING ANALYTICS AND DATA PRIVACY IN MOOCs,MOOCs; Learning Analytics; Data Privacy; Big Data; Higher Education,,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), as a new educational trend, attract worldwide a huge number of learners giving them appropriate knowledge according to personal needs. Learners are stimulated to be active participants and facilitated to create distributed learning communities through: sharing opinions and setting preferences; analyzing, annotating and translating learning materials; participating in interactive gaming exercises; communicating with other participants, tutors and guest lectures; preparing and submitting practical assignments; group working and peer rewieving; proposing other useful (open) educational resources; publishing insights on different Social Media platforms. Therefore, during participating in Massive Open Online Courses a wide variety of students' personal and activity data are collected and used for different purposes by tutors, hosting platforms and possible third party actors, such as universities or companies. Part of this big data is processed by the Learning Analytics modules, in order to understand and optimize the learning process. The questions that arise are: - What kind of students' private data are shared and why?, - What are the privacy models provided by MOOCs?, - What data is needed for Learning Analytics modules?, - Are there any third party actors processing the students' data and why?, - Which are the relations between Learning Analytics and Data Privacy?, - Is it possible for the learners to be protected?. The paper is looking for answers of the above placed questions summarizing and analyzing the current projects and practices, best learning cases and research standpoints. The findings are used for development of a model presenting a possibility to ensure data privacy in MOOCs. The analysis, model and conclusions indicate the positive features and bandgaps in the area of data privacy in the context of MOOCs. They could be used in the form of directions for developers of MOOCs with aim to guarantee data privacy of learners."
Netflixing human capital development: personalized learning technology and the corporatization of K-12 education,Personalized learning; corporatization; big data; educational technology,,"Advanced by powerful venture philanthropies, educational technology companies, and the US Department of Education, a growing movement to apply 'big data' through 'learning analytics' to create 'personalized learning' is currently underway in K-12 education in the United States. While scholars have offered various critiques of the corporate school reform agenda, the role of personalized learning technology in the corporatization of public education has not been extensively examined. Through a content analysis of US Department of Education reports, personalized learning advocacy white papers, and published research monographs, this paper details how big data and adaptive learning systems are functioning to redefine educational policy, teaching, and learning in ways that transfer educational decisions from public school classrooms and teachers to private corporate spaces and authorities. The analysis shows that all three types of documents position education within a reductive set of economic rationalities that emphasize human capital development, the expansion of data-driven instruction and decision-making, and a narrow conception of learning as the acquisition of discrete skills and behavior modification detached from broader social contexts and culturally relevant forms of knowledge and inquiry. The paper concludes by drawing out the contradictions inherent to personalized learning technology and corporatization of schooling. It argues that these contradictions necessitate a broad rethinking of the value and purpose of new educational technology."
Big Data for Individual Education: an angel or a monster?,Big Data; individual education; Learning Analytics; opportunities and challenges; coping strategies,ANALYTICS,"The rapid development of Information technology has brought the era of Big Data, a buzzword now familiar among most people, which has generated a huge influence on human social lives including politics, economics, culture and so on, which has also transformed the education. With various online courses emerging at different kinds of websites, huge volumes of data of learners has been generated, from attendance rates to test scores, to track the learners comprehensively. Now, by Learning Analytics technology, many educational institutions use these data to analyze students' interests, performance and behavioral issues and then make a personalized plan accordingly, promoting the development of individual education. In China, little research has been done between Big Data and individual education, so this paper aims to show the opportunities and challenges created by the Big Data, put forward some coping strategies when facing the challenges and provide a reference for the other researchers to make a further study."

How will The Internet of Things and Big Data Analytics impact the Education of Learning-Disabled Students? A Concept Paper,smart education; dyslexia/dyscalculia; personalized learning; individualized teaching; Internet of Things; Big Data Analytics; (virtual) learning; social and economic impacts; Smart City technology,,"In the last decade, the increasing plurality of materials, media types and software tools within the internet has established first steps towards more individualized learning approaches. However, the development of utilizing Big Data-based algorithms of the next internet generation, the so-called 'Internet of Things', leads to a comprehensive approach of personalized learning for very different target groups. Understanding the learner's profile and interests, learning goals and learning difficulties, 'intelligent agents' accompany and guide the learner during the learning process in the future. In particular, for students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia and dyscalculia, the new development of 'learning analytics' based on Big Data algorithms has a large potential. The goal is to overcome the severe gap between their existing intellectual potentials and their often unsuccessful learning biographies in schools and universities. The changes of daily environments towards a 4.0-Society, in particular through fully networked Smart Cities, result in an increasing number of data from very heterogeneous sources. Due to technologies such as, e.g., smart wearables combined with data generated through traffic and mobility or logistics, smart geographical places will be enabled to act as a basis for intelligent learning and evaluation mechanisms."
Technology-enhanced learning and co-operative practice against the neoliberal university,Co-operation; higher education; neoliberalism; technology-enhanced learning; university,,"Neoliberalism is a global pedagogical project aimed at the dispossession of free time so that all of life becomes productive, and education is a central institutional means for its realisation. This project aims at marketising all of social life, so that life becomes predicated upon the extraction of value. In part the deployment of technologies, technical services, and techniques enables education to be co-opted as an institutional means for production and control. This occurs inside both formal and informal educational institutions and spaces, like universities and Massive Open On-line Courses, as one mechanism to offset the tendency for the rate of profit to fall and to re-establish accumulation. This pedagogic project also tends to recalibrate and enclose the roles of staff and students as entrepreneurial subjects, whose labour is enabled through technology. This is achieved through learning analytics, big data, mobility and flexibility of provision, and so on. At issue is the extent to which this neoliberal project can be resisted or refused, and alternatives described. This article will analyse the relationships between technology, pedagogy, and the critical subject in the neoliberal University, in order to argue for the use of technology inside a co-operative pedagogy of struggle. This demands that we ask what education is, before we ask what it is for, or the place of technology-enhanced learning in the university. The article considers whether it is possible to uncover ways in which education might be used for co-operation rather than competition, and what technology-enhanced co-operative education might look like?"
A FORMALISM FOR PLAN A BIG DATA PERSONAL LEARNING ASSISTANT FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS,personal learning system; big data; learning recommendation systems; learning models; e-learning,,"Big Data-based methods of learning analytics are increasingly relied on by institutions of higher learning in order to increase student retention by identifying at risk students who are in need of an intervention to allow them to continue on in their educational endeavors. It is well known that e-Learning students are even more at risk of failing out of university than are traditional students, so Big Data learning analytics are even more appropriate in this context. In this paper, we present our approach to this problem. We wish to place control of a student's learning process in his own hands, rather than that of the learning institution in order to decouple the student from the institution since the goals and motivations of these two may not be completely aligned. In this way, we empower the student by giving him control of the personal learning system which employs Big Data techniques to generate recommendations on how to reach a set of learner-specific learning goals. We present the formalism which underlies our system, the architecture which implements the system, scenarios for system use, a survey of related works and thoughts on how the system will be implemented in a prototype in the future."
EVALUATING A MIXED-REALITY 3D VIRTUAL CAMPUS WITH BIG DATA AND LEARNING ANALYTICS: A TRANSVERSAL STUDY,3D virtual campus; tracking system; Learning Analytics; pedagogical effectiveness; OpenSimulator,WORLDS; EDUCATION,"There is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of the 3D multi-user virtual environments (3DMUVEs) with high relevance for prospective developments and improvements in both distant and in-class education. However, to be accepted on a larger scale by education practitioners more analitical studies are required to evaluate these environments against usability and pedagogical effectiveness criteria. The present paper proposes an automatic in-world monitoring system consisting in scripted tracking objects and Learning Analytics (LA) tools for an experimental 3D virtual campus. The research was conducted within a transversal study using focus groups from two universities, an engineering and a vocational one. The results highlighted the validity of the automated system and LA tools, which can constitute the ground for more efficient teaching and learning in complex activity-based 3D educational settings."

Educational Data Mining and Big Data Framework for e-Learning Environment,E-learning; Big Data Framework; Augmented learning; Adaptive learning,,"E-learning data consists of large volume of educational data and available with complex and hybrid data architecture. Capturing of student performances, student evaluation and student's interaction information are one of the challenges faced by the e-learning software users at the time of analysis. Integrating student data along with educational data for analysis needs complex system design framework. New innovations in e-learning also facilitates augmented learning, adaptive learning, web based learning, activity based learning, and project based learning. Education technology interventions using learning management system, content management system, advanced distributed learning; sharable content object reference models and application program interfaces enhanced and extended the e-learning frameworks to a greater horizon. Present technology also ensures transformations of e-learning information without any geographical barriers. These educational and student or user data combined together forms big data architecture under e-learning environment and mining these big data for various requirements or knowledge discoveries needs innovative approaches.

Towards A Smart Learning Environment for Smart City Governance,Smart Learning Environment; Technology-enhanced learning; e-Learning; Smart City Governance; Open Participatory Planning; Learning Analytics; Big data,CITIES,"Educational services provided to various stakeholders need to be actively developed to accommodate the diversity of learning models and to get the advantages of available resources (e.g. data) in smart cities governance. Despite the substantial literature on smart cities, for Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) and its related domains such as learning analytics and big data, little effort has been given to the creation of connectivity to smart cities governance to meet stakeholders' demands, even though this connection may generate various challenges arising from conflict of interests between stakeholders and organisations. This paper proposes a structural framework for successful application of smart learning environments in the context of smart city governance. It reflects on selected challenges and proposes some future directions."
Big Data Application in Education: Dropout Prediction in Edx MOOCs,MOOC; Big Data; Dropout prediction; Supervised learning,,"Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics are two growing fields of study, trying to make sense of education data and to improve teaching and learning experience. We study dropout prediction in Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCS), where the goal is given student's learning behavior log data in one month, to predict whether students would drop out in next ten days. We collect 39 courses data from XuetangX platform, which is based on the open source Edx platform. We describe our complete approach to cope with drop out prediction task, including data extraction from Edx platform, data preprocessing, feature engineering and performance test on several supervised classification model such as SVM, Logistics Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree.

Information Systems Innovation Adoption in Higher Education: Big Data and Analytics,Big data; analytic; learning analytics; IS adoption; academic analytics; predictive analytics,,"Much as the term analytics is not new in the research field. However, analytics and big data are still not fully understood, nor yet been thoroughly and empirically researched by institutions of higher education (HE), more so, in the South African context. Many organizations and businesses are welcoming and adopting such an information system innovation. However, there has been a limited interest in the adoption big data and analytics in institutions of HE. The lack of interest in big data and analytics from HE institutions has caused institutions to function with substantial delays in analysing readily evident data. Furthermore, the lack of adequate theoretical frameworks for IS adoption in HE institutions has steered the many failures to produce meaningful, accessible and timely information for decision making. Therefore this calls for the development of a conceptualized framework for the adoption of big data and analytics in institutions of HE."
Using Small Data to Support the Design Process of Learning Environments,learning analytics; online education; design science research; design; small data,SCIENCE,"Learning Analytics is seen as a promising way of improving online education, focusing on how students learn and how teachers' can help the students' to be effective in that process. Most approaches rely on the idea of Big Data to be the foundation upon which to design for assisting the students' learning process, the teachers' scaffolding efforts or enhancement of the interaction design of the software. In this paper, we depart from a case of e-training of clerks in a public organisation. It is argued that learning analytics and educational mining based on Small Data (i.e. use-pattern log data from a small set of learners) also have a promising potential for extracting design guidelines for an e-training environment and not only provide support after the system is developed and implemented, but also guide the design of future e-training systems."
The Case for Small Data in Higher Education,Small data; learning analytics; teacher evaluation; Learning management Systems; learning tools,HABITS,"While colleges and universities seek to utilize big, complex and aggregated data to generate insights to support students, big data is limited in its use to design interventions due to limits it inherently has. Small data, or one-dimensional teaching and learning analytics, provide quality feedback to teachers and students. In this paper, we will discuss how Abilene Christian University (ACU), a private university in the western region of the United States, uses alert system to serve at-risk students, IDEA evaluations to gather feedback to improve teaching, and data from the use of a learning management system Canvas to identify ways to improve student learning by providing formative evaluation for faculty to improve their practices. Towards the end of the paper we will discuss what students can do to make informed choices about their learning."
Can online student performance be forecasted by learning analytics?,academic performance; big data analytics; ICT in higher education; Moodle engagement analytics; online undergraduate business course; student learning performance,PEER ASSESSMENT; DESIGN,"The paper focuses on utilising learning analytics to assess student performance in an online business. The value of this paper is in the literature review and the process used for analysis since it provides a way of how research in Moodle learning analytics or other similar systems could be leveraged to track student progress and for retention. The engagement analytics module is a relatively new component of Moodle but it has not yet been investigated with respect to student performance or in online business courses. The purpose of this study was to examine the predictive relationships between student academic performance and Moodle engagement analytics indicators along with student online activity data from the system logs. Unfortunately none of the hypothesised learning analytics factors were positively related to, nor could they predict, student academic performance. However, several interesting deductions from the learning analytics data gave rise to ideas for further research. Sense making of puzzling statistics suggested a mediating pattern of students' poor self-regulation skills because more focus was put on the assignment requirements but less on interacting with the lesson materials needed to complete the assignment and thereby resulting in lower grades."
BIG DATA FOR SOCIAL MEDIA LEARNING ANALYTICS: POTENTIALS AND CHALLENGES,MOOCs; social media; social learning analytics; open datasets; big data; privacy & security; ethics; data anonymization,ISSUES; SUPPORT; PRIVACY,"Today, the information gathered from massive learning platforms and social media sites allows to derive a very comprehensive set of learning information. To this aim, data mining techniques can surely help to gain proper insights, personalise learning experiences, formative assessments, performance measurements, as well as to develop new learning and instructional design models. Therefore, a core requirement is to classify, mix, filter and process the big data sources involved by means of proper learning and social learning analytics tools. In this perspective, this paper investigates the most promising applications and issues of big data for the design of the next-generation of massive learning platforms and social media sites. Specifically, it addresses the methodological tools and instruments for social learning analytics, pitfalls arising from the usage of open datasets, and privacy and security aspects.

Taiwan's Digital Learning Initiative and Big Data Analytics in Education Cloud,Big data; Education cloud; Digital learning; learning analytics,,"Taiwan's Ministry of Education (MoE) started planning and promoting comprehensive Digital Learning Initiative in 2013. It is expected that teachers and students can use broadband networks in campus in 2017. Students can do online learning with different kinds of digital devices at any time. Besides, students can do ubiquitous learning by getting digital learning resources on cloud devices. Teachers can grasp innovative teaching strategies with the application of digital technology and design the learning activities that are more adaptive to individual students. Students have the information force of mobile learning, the abilities to use information tools and grasp the information, as well as Internet literacy and ethics. The learning model of education at all levels will transform into student-centered to facilitate justice, public, autonomy and adaptive learning opportunities as well as make students in the country and those in the city have equal digital learning opportunities. Digital Learning Initiative will have profound influence on education system. Education cloud (EduCloud) is the flagship of the digital learning initiative. This paper presents our research and experience of applying Big data analytics to the EduCloud. We address Big data infrastructure and analytics to cover the issues of data collection, cleaning, storage, query, analytics, and visualization in order to make EduCloud more suitable for teachers and students in Taiwan."
Datafication in Education: A Multi-Level Challenge for IT in Educational Management,Educational governance; ICT management; Datafication; Information technology governance,INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; LEARNING ANALYTICS; USER ACCEPTANCE; BIG DATA; GOVERNANCE; SYSTEMS; NUMBERS,"While data-driven decision-making has become a new paradigm for school development and accountability, research on the underlying ICT infrastructures and the ICT management processes have been less prominent. With the trend of datafication, educational management gains new options but also requires adequate controlling mechanisms to take care of the data and to account for privacy and security. The information management cycle can be used to define all relevant aspects of the management process. This is adopted to the specific situation of educational institutions and furthermore extended to account for the different levels of educational governance. This leads to a new concept of educational technology governance as a necessary frame for supporting datafication processes."
Learning Fractions by Splitting: Using Learning Analytics to Illuminate the Development of Mathematical Understanding,,BIG DATA; INSTRUCTION; NUMERACY; PATTERNS; STUDENTS; MODELS; NUMBER; HEALTH,"The struggle with fraction learning in kindergarten through Grade 12 in the United States is a persistent problem and one of the major stumbling blocks to succeeding in higher mathematics. Research into this problem has identified several areas where students commonly struggle with fractions. While there are many theories of fraction learning, none of the research on these theories employs samples large enough to test theories at scale or nuanced enough to demonstrate how learning unfolds over time during instructional activities based on these theories. The work reported here uses learning analytics methods with fine-grained log data from an online fraction game to unpack how splitting (i.e. partitioning a whole into equal-sized parts) impacts learning. Study 1 demonstrated that playing the game significantly improved students' fraction understanding. In addition, a cluster analysis suggested that exploring splitting was beneficial. Study 2 replicated the learning results, and a cluster analysis showed that compared to early game play, later game play showed more optimal splitting strategies. In addition, in looking at the types of transitions that were possible between a student's early cluster categorization and later cluster categorization, we found that some types of transitions were more beneficial for learning than others."
Relational event models for social learning in MOOCs,Relational event models; Social learning analytics; MOOCs,,"We propose three extensions for the relational event framework to model the co-evolution of multiple network event streams which are increasingly available thanks to the explosive growth of online applications. Firstly, a flexible stratification approach is considered to allow for more complex data structures with many types of nodes and events. Secondly, an inference method that combines nested case-control sampling with stratification is discussed to scale the approach to very large data sets. Finally, a suite of new temporal and network statistics is introduced to reflect the potentially complex dependencies among events and observed heterogeneities on nodes and edges. The empirical value of new extensions is demonstrated through an analysis of social learning in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In particular, three modeling problems are considered from the network perspective: (1) the utility of social factors, performance indicators, and clickstream behaviors in the prediction of course dropout, (2) the social and temporal structure of learner interactions across discussion threads, and (3) the forms of mutual dependence of social learning interactions on prior learning success, and future learning success on forms of prior social learning interaction.

"Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics: differences, similarities, and time evolution",Online Learning; Educational Data Mining; Learning Analytics; Big Data,BIG DATA; INTERNET,"Technological progress in recent decades has enabled people to learn in different ways. Universities now have more educational models to choose from, i.e., b-learning and e-learning. Despite the increasing opportunities for students and instructors, online learning also brings challenges due to the absence of direct human contact. Online environments allow the generation of large amounts of data related to learning/teaching processes, which offers the possibility of extracting valuable information that may be employed to improve students' performance. In this paper, we aim to review the similarities and differences between Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics, two relatively new and increasingly popular fields of research concerned with the collection, analysis, and interpretation of educational data. Their origins, goals, differences, similarities, time evolution, and challenges are addressed, as are their relationship with Big Data and MOOCs."
The skinny on big data in education: Learning analytics simplified,big data; learning analytics; trends in education,,"This paper examines the current state of learning analytics (LA), its stakeholders and the benefits and challenges these stakeholders face. LA is a field of research that involves the gathering, analyzing and reporting of data related to learners and their environments with the purpose of optimizing the learning experience. Stakeholders in LA are students, educators, researchers, institutions, and government agencies. The way in which analytics information flows from students to other stakeholders involves a hierarchy, where all stakeholders are able to provide input and offer recommendations to enrich the learning process for the student. Challenges faced by stakeholders include the movement of traditional analytics to learner-centered analytics, working with datasets across various settings, addressing issues with technology and resolving ethical concerns. Despite these challenges, research points to solutions that will allow LA to transform teaching and learning."
Big(ger) Data as Better Data in Open Distance Learning,Big Data; learning analytics; student success,BIG DATA; TECHNOLOGY; EDUCATION; SURVEILLANCE; METAPHORS,"In the context of the hype, promise and perils of Big Data and the currently dominant paradigm of data-driven decision-making, it is important to critically engage with the potential of Big Data for higher education. We do not question the potential of Big Data, but we do raise a number of issues, and present a number of theses to be seriously considered in realising this potential. The University of South Africa (Unisa) is one of the mega ODL institutions in the world with more than 360,000 students and a range of courses and programmes. Unisa already has access to a staggering amount of student data, hosted in disparate sources, and governed by different processes. As the university moves to mainstreaming online learning, the amount of and need for analyses of data are increasing, raising important questions regarding our assumptions, understanding, data sources, systems and processes. This article presents a descriptive case study of the current state of student data at Unisa, as well as explores the impact of existing data sources and analytic approaches. From the analysis it is clear that in order for big(ger) data to be better data, a number of issues need to be addressed. The article concludes by presenting a number of theses that should form the basis for the imperative to optimise the harvesting, analysis and use of student data."

Drawing on and combining concepts from software studies, policy and political studies, it identifies some specific approaches to digital governance facilitated by network-based communications and database-driven information processing software that are being discursively promoted in education by cross-sectoral intermediary organizations. Such intermediaries, including National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, Demos, the Innovation Unit, the Education Foundation and the Nominet Trust, are increasingly seeking to participate in new digitally mediated forms of educational governance. Through their promotion of network-based pedagogies and database-driven analytics software, these organizations are seeking to delegate educational decision-making to socio-algorithmic forms of power that have the capacity to predict, govern and activate learners' capacities and subjectivities."
Predicting student's learning outcome from Learning Management system logs,educational data mining; learning analytics; Hadoop; Big Data; student modeling,,"Teaching is complex activity which requires professors to employ the most effective and efficient teaching strategies to enable students to make progress. Main problem in teaching professors should consider different teaching approaches and learning techniques to suit every student. Today, in computer age, electronic learning (e-learning) is widely used in practice. Development of World Wide Web, especially Web2.0 has led to revolution in education. Student interaction with Learning management systems - LMS result in creating large data sets which are interesting for research. LMS systems also provide tools for following every individual student and statistical view for deeper analyzing result of student - system interaction. However, these tools do not include artificial intelligence algorithms as a support mechanism for decision. In this article we provide framework for student modeling trained on large sets of data using Hadoop and Mahout. This kind of system would provide insight into each individual student's activity. Based on that information, professors could adjust course materials according to student interest and knowledge."

Learning Analytics Solution for Reducing Learners' Course Failure Rate,learning analytics; big data; parallel particle swarm optimization clustering; Naive Bayes prediction; recommendation system; learner's competence; big data,,"In recent years, learning analytics solutions have highly appealed to the higher education community who mainly focuses on improving the learning process, self-regulated learning skills, and learners' success rate. Learning analytics has to deal with continuous data, however, conventional data mining algorithms are not readily applicable to handle the continuous incoming of learners' data. In order to cope with these scenarios, the proposed learning analytics aimed to manage the continuous data, perform the clustering process using the optimization approach, detect the 'at-risk' learners' who are in a course failure situation, and generate signals to learners and teachers. Based on the predicted outcome, the proposed system identifies and adapts the learning activities and learning contents to help learners find their way out of their learning difficulties and course failure situation. The experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed work using the simulated learners' data. The experimental results provide empirical evidence that the proposed work reduces the course failure rate and improves learners' success rate."

"Comparing MOOC-Based Platforms: Reflection on Pedagogical Support, Framework and Learning Analytics",MOOC; EdX; Udacity; Coursera; Learning analytics,,"The rapidly expanding, highly evolving online course market (Massive Open Online Course or MOOC) is influential in academia. Many well-known MOOC platforms have emerged over the last decade. There is a need to compare the support level offered by these platforms so that educators can deliver materials and students are able to learn better. Additionally, there is a need to explore what kinds of data are gathered from these platforms to exploit big data analytics opportunities. This paper evaluates three major online MOOC course providers namely Coursera, EdX, and Udacity. We first compare these platforms in terms of pedagogical support and implemented technologies. We then look at the literature and compare learning analytics support among these tools that are currently offered. We also suggest a set of analytics concepts that can aid interaction data and generate guidance for effective teaching."

One such family of applications is the one of analytics based on processing big data. More specifically, there is a large family of analytics applications from processing log data files. Indeed, log data files are commonplace in many Internet-based systems and applications, comprising system logs, server logs, application logs, databases logs, user activity logs, etc. These applications are analytics oriented applications based on processing the various types of log files. While log data file processing has been recently an issue of investigation by many researchers and developers, the new feature is that of scale: Cloud based systems can enable processing unlimited amount of data either off-line or online in streaming mode. In this work we evaluate the performance of a MapReduce Hadoop-based implementation for processing large log data files of a Virtual Campus. The study aims to reveal the potential of using such implementations as a basis for learning analytics for use by a variety of users in a Virtual Campus."
Performance Analysis of Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization Based Clustering of Students,e-learning; learning analytics; clustering; parallel particle swarm optimization (PPSO); parallel processing; hadoop distributed file system (HDFS),,"While accurate computational models that embody learning efficiency remain a distant and elusive goal, big data learning analytics approaches this goal by recognizing competency growth of learners, at various levels of granularity, using a combination of continuous, formative, and summative assessments. Our earlier research employed the conventional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based clustering mechanism to cluster large numbers of learners based on their observed study habits and the consequent growth of subject knowledge competencies. This paper describes a Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO) based clustering mechanism to cluster learners. Using a simulation study, performance measures of quality of clusters such as the Inter Cluster Distance, the Intra Cluster Distance, the processing time and the acceleration values are estimated and compared."
Enhancing Educational Data Mining Techniques on Online Educational Resources with A Semi-Supervised Learning Approach,educational data mining; explicit semantic analysis; knowledge components; semi-supervised learning,,"Both educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) focus on applying analytics and data mining techniques to extract useful information from large data sets. EDM is generally more interested in automated methods for discovery within the educational data while LA is relatively keen on applying human-led methods to understand the involved learning processes. Among the various fields of challenging studies in EDM, domain structure discovery is aimed to find the structure of knowledge in an educational domain, such as formulating the prerequisite requirements among various knowledge components through online educational resources. However, with the vast amount of knowledge components in specific subjects, the process of such formulation is very complicated and time-consuming no matter being done manually or semi-automatically. In this work, we propose a systematic framework of a semi-supervised learning approach in which a concept-based classifier is co-trained with an explicit semantic analysis (ESA) classifier to derive a common set of prerequisite rules based on a diverse set of online educational resources. To demonstrate its feasibility, a working prototype is built with some impressive results obtained in specific engineering subjects. More importantly, our proposal sheds light on many possible directions for future exploration."
Research on interactive E-learning platform based on data mining and cloud computing: A review,Data Mining; Cloud Computing; Big Data; Hadoop; Interactive E-Learning,,"With the fast development of computer science and technology, a combination of a web service and E-learning platform is a hot research topic. When the learning process becomes digitized, educational data mining employs the information generated from the electronic sources to enrich the learning model for academic purposes. To provide support for e-learning systems, cloud computing is set as a natural platform, as it can be dynamically adapted by presenting a scalable system for the changing necessities of the computer resources over time. We give an overview of the current state of the structure of the cloud computing, we provide details of the most common infrastructure, has been to develop such a system. We also present some examples of e-learning approaches for cloud computing, and finally, we discuss the suitability of this environment for educational data mining, suggesting the migration of this approach to this computational scenario. As the final analysis, we present our future potential research area."
Smart Learning Analytics,SCALE framework; smart learning environment; programming; e-learning technologies; novice programming; big data learning analytics,,"A smart learning environment (SLE) is characterized by the key provision of personalized learning experiences. To approach different degrees of personalization in online learning, this paper introduces a framework called SCALE that tracks finer level learning experiences and translates them into opportunities for custom feedback. A prototype version of the SCALE system has been used in a study to track the habits of novice programmers. Growth of coding competencies of first year engineering students has been captured in a continuous manner. Students have been provided with customized feedback to optimize their learning path in programming. This paper describes key aspects of our research with the SCALE system and highlights results of the study."
Unfolding Learning Analytics for Big Data,learning management systems; programming; coding competency; bigdata; learning traces; learning analytics; training,,"Educational applications, in general, treat disparate study threads as a singular entity, bundle pedagogical intervention and other student support services at a coarser level, and summatively assess final products of assessments. In this research, we propose an analytics framework where we closely monitor individual threads of study habits and assess study threads in an individual fashion to trace learning processes leading into assessment products. We developed customized intervention to target specific skills and nurture optimal study habits. The framework has been implemented in a system called SCALE (Smart Causal Analytics on LEaming). SCALE enables the tracking of students' individual study threads towards multiple final study products. The large volume, multiple variety, and incessant flow of data classifies our work in the realms of big data analytics. We conducted a preliminary study using SCALE. The results show the ability of the system to track the evolution of competencies. We propose that explicitly supporting the development of a targeted set of competencies is one of the key tenets of Smart Learning Environments."
A New Data Mining Model Adopted for Higher Institutions,Data Models; Data Preprocessing; Higher Education Institution (HEI); Data Mining; Admission System; Educational Data Mining,,"In the current times, one of the biggest challenges that educational institutions face in both the developing and developed nations is the explosive growth of educational data and to use this data to improve the quality of managerial decisions. Data mining techniques are considered as an analytical tool can be used to extract meaningful knowledge from these large data sets. The quality of higher education institutions implies providing the services, which most likely meet the needs of students, academic staff, and other participants in the education system. This paper proposes a new Data Mining model to be applied in higher education institutions. The suggested model assists in decision making process in the strategic levels of higher institutions as well as regulates the disciplines of students' admission."
SmartLAK: A Big Data Architecture for Supporting Learning Analytics Services,Big data architecture; Learning analytics; Experience API,,"In this paper, we present a big data software architecture that uses an ontology, based on the Experience API specification, to semantically represent the data streams generated by the learners when they undertake the learning activities of a course, e.g., in a course. These data are stored in a RDF database to provide a high performance access so learning analytics services can process the large amount of data generated in a virtual learning environment. These services provide valuable information to teachers and instructors such as predict the learner's performance, discover the real learning paths, extract the learner's behavior patterns and so on. The proposed architecture has been validated in the Educational Technology undergraduate course of the Degree in Pedagogy at the Faculty of Education of the University of Santiago de Compostela."
Towards a DSL for Educational Data Mining,Domain-specific languages; Big data; Educational data mining,,"Nowadays, most companies and organizations rely on computer systems to run their work processes. Therefore, the analysis of how these systems are used can be an important source of information to improve these work processes. In the era of Big Data, this is perfectly feasible with current state-of-art data analysis tools. Nevertheless, these data analysis tools cannot be used by general users, as they require a deep and sound knowledge of the algorithms and techniques they implement. In other areas of computer science, domain-specific languages have been created to abstract users from low level details of complex technologies. Therefore, we believe the same solution could be applied for data analysis tools. This article explores this hypothesis by creating a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for the educational domain."
Re-conceptualizing learning ecologies and learning analytics as rhizome,Learning Analytics; Learning Ecologies; Rhizome; Learning 2.0,,"The penetration of social media in everyday life has resulted in a corresponding growth in the availability of large data-sets, so called 'Big Data', emergent from tracking and/or mining of user interactions in online settings. It is now possible to better support (and even predict) learner/s achievement through analysis of their interactions within online learning environments. Learning Analytics involves the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of online data about learners and their contexts, for the purposes of understanding, adapting and optimizing the process of learning and/or the environments in which it occurs. In the context of education, the analysis of this data has the potential to help us learn more about learners' frames of reference, learning styles, preferred modes of learning and patterns of behavior in learning environments. This paper considers learning analytics in online learning ecologies, and posits the rhizome/rhizomatic thinking introduced by Deleuze and Guattari as inspiration for re-conceptualising the processes of learning analytics in the 21st Century."
A Conceptual Design Framework for Big Data Based Learning Analysis,big data; learning assessment; learning analytics; design framework; data cube,,"Beyond clipped or isolated data, big data highlights the integrated and all-around mining of the data related to some subject, which provides an innovative perspective for learning assessment, and big data based learning analytics explores a new approach to learning evaluation and improvement. Key points in terms of big data based process typically involve where to capture the big data, what data to use and how to handle the collected data. This paper proposes a conceptual design framework for big data supported learning assessment. A three-dimensional data resources model, a learning data cube, and a four-stage process model are separately suggested to respond to the mentioned Where, What, and How questions."
Learning Analytics: The next frontier for computer assisted language learning in big data age,learning analytics; big data; CALL; media,MEDIA,"Learning analytics (LA) has been applied to various learning environments, though it is quite new in the field of computer assisted language learning (CALL). This article attempts to examine the application of learning analytics in the upcoming big data age. It starts with an introduction and application of learning analytics in other fields, followed by a retrospective review of historical interaction between learning and media in CALL, and a penetrating analysis on why people would go to learning analytics to increase the efficiency of foreign language education. As approved in previous research, new technology, including big data mining and analysis, would inevitably enhance the learning of foreign languages. Potential changes that learning analytics would bring to Chinese foreign language education and researches are also presented in the article."
Learning Analytics for English Language Teaching,Learning Analytics; Big Data Analysis; Educational data mining; E-learning,,"In recent times, online learning platforms get more and more attention and the number of collected data is growing. Learning analytics is a valuable opportunity to gain specific information for a better understanding of student's learning behaviour and to improve their learning success. In this work, the collected data of the online learning platform www. more-online. at is analysed and first research results are presented. The main objective is to analyse the usage behaviour over a school year and to show the diffusion of the online platform among provinces in Austria, different school types and other characteristics. Furthermore, the content of the online platform is put under closer examination to enable decisions about the efficiency and effectiveness of different types of exercises."
Integrating Learning Analytics for higher-order thinking e-assessments,learning analytics; big data; data mining; e-assessments; higher order thinking skills (HOTS),,"This paper attempts to understand the broader implications for integrating learning analytics in e-learning systems. This is also the commencement of a collaborative effort for developing research bases around learning analytics between the University of Mauritius and the University of KwaZuluNatal. The focus on e-assessments is deliberate: the tendancy in both our universities to appraise student learning as summative and quantitative does not reflect contemporary workplace and scholarly needs where learning processes are more valuable than outcomes. The necessity for epistemological rethinking and developing systems based on contextual requirements is important, whether it is related to curriculum development or workshop organisation or even conducting a class. After a survey of the literature on the potentials and hypes around learning analytics, we look towards the literature linking learning analytics, data mining and e-assessment for educators to interface more effectively and efficiently with the LMS platform. We conclude this concept-paper with a workshop outline which can help educational technologists organise practical, sustainable and meaningful hands-on sessions with educators."
Sources of Evidence-of-Learning: Learning and assessment in the era of big data,big data; assessment; machine learning; learning analytics; educational data mining,TECHNOLOGY; INSTRUCTION; STATES,"This article sets out to explore a shift in the sources of evidence-of-learning in the era of networked computing. One of the key features of recent developments has been popularly characterized as 'big data'. We begin by examining, in general terms, the frame of reference of contemporary debates on machine intelligence and the role of machines in supporting and extending human intelligence. We go on to explore three kinds of application of computers to the task of providing evidence-of-learning to students and teachers: (1) the mechanization of tests-for instance, computer adaptive testing, and automated essay grading; (2) data mining of unstructured data-for instance, the texts of student interaction with digital artifacts, textual interactions with each other, and body sensors; (3) the design and analysis of mechanisms for the collection and analysis of structured data embedded within the learning process-for instance, in learning management systems, intelligent tutors, and simulations. A consequence of each and all of these developments is the potential to record and analyze the 'big data' that is generated. The article presents both an optimistic view of what may be possible as these technologies and pedagogies evolve, while offering cautionary warnings about associated dangers."
Endless horizons? Addressing current concerns about learning analytics,Learning Analytics; Big Data; Tiny Data; Decision Making; Ethical Issues; Common Frameworks; Integration,,"A few years after the emergence of learning analytics as a relevant topic in educational research, which has been accompanied by several publications devoted to the theme, we still see how the different topics seem to alternate both converging and diverging trends. Thus, whereas sometimes different approaches seem to converge into the study of the same issue or situation, other times the same approaches are applied to solve different problems in a divergent way. This situation becomes more complex with the added inclusion of new technological advances and analysis techniques, as a result of which the extension of the scope of learning analytics as a discipline may be perceived as endless or boundless. This is an introduction to the Track on Learning Analytics within the Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality 2015 Conference, which aims to address some of the current concerns on learning analytics and help clearing the horizon. This introductory paper provides an overview of the rationale of the track's proposal, including different topics open for discussion; the introduction is followed by an insight of the submission management and participants' selection process. Then, a detailed summary of the manuscripts accepted for participation in the conference is presented."
Student data mining solution-knowledge management system related to higher education institutions,Data mining; Knowledge management system; Student's success rate; Data mining for small data set; Higher education institution; Educational data mining,,"Higher education institutions (HEIs) are often curious whether students will be successful or not during their study. Before or during their courses the academic institutions try to estimate the percentage of successful students. But is it possible to predict the success rate of students enrolled in their courses? Are there any specific student characteristics, which can be associated with the student success rate? Is there any relevant student data available to HEIs on the basis of which they could predict the student success rate? The answers to the above research questions can generally be obtained using data mining tools. Unfortunately, data mining algorithms work best with large data sets, while student data, available to HEIs, related to courses are limited and falls into the category of small data sets. Thus, the study focuses on data mining for small student data sets and aims to answer the above research questions by comparing two different data mining tools. The conclusions of this study are very promising and will encourage HEIs to incorporate data mining tools as an important part of their higher education knowledge management systems.

A Learning Analytics Methodology for Student Profiling,Data Analytics; Social Network Analysis; Text Mining; Educational Data Mining; Learning Analytics,,"On a daily basis, a large amount of data is gathered through the participation of students in e-learning environments. This wealth of data is an invaluable asset to researchers as they can utilize it in order to generate conclusions and identify hidden patterns and trends by using big data analytics techniques. The purpose of this study is a threefold analysis of the data that are related to the participation of students in the online forums of their University. In one hand the content of the messages posted in these fora can be efficiently analyzed by text mining techniques. On the other hand, the network of students interacting through a forum can be adequately processed through social network analysis techniques. Still, the combined knowledge attained from both of the aforementioned techniques, can provide educators with practical and valuable information for the evaluation of the learning process, especially in a distance learning environment. The study was conducted by using real data originating from the online forums of the Hellenic Open University (HOU). The analysis of the data has been accomplished by using the R and the Weka tools, in order to analyze the structure and the content of the exchanged messages in these fora as well as to model the interaction of the students in the discussion threads."
Pocket Data Analytics: An Introduction to Practical Applications of Course Analytics in Online Learning,Pocket data analytics; online learning; learning analytics; practical application; student engagement; student performance,,"The concept of using academic analytics to understand trends in a student population is not a new idea. much of the analysis of these massive numbers live in the Massive or Big Data analysis of information for whole programs. There is little evidence that instructors are using smaller samplings weekly, or even daily analytics, to improve performance and engagement. For the purposes of this paper, let us call this data: Pocket Data Analytics. This paper will provide an introduction to the practical application of analytics in which instructors can use to proactively improve student engagement and performance. These changes would occur during an on-going semester. According to Swan (2012), Online learning seems to be on the frontlines of the learning analytics movement, and so online educators need to inform themselves about learning analytics."
The Adaptive Teaching in the Setting of Big Data,big data; adaptive teaching system; learning analytics; educational data mining,,"Education is one of important application fields of big data, and with the technology developing of big data, education data in scale is becoming larger and larger, and the breadth and depth of data are expanding. Through techniques of learning analytics and educational data mining, educators can get information of students' learning performances, such as learning attitudes, interests and effects, predict students' learning behaviors in future, find the possible problems hidden in the process of learning, and then try to provide the most suitable teaching contents and activities for the adaptive teaching. This paper discussed the influences of big data on education and teaching, expounded the applications of learning analytics and educational data mining in the adaptive teaching, and lastly presented a functional structure of a typical adaptive teaching system."
"A Domain-Driven, Generative Data Model for BigPetStore",big data; synthetic data sets; data generation; benchmarking; testing; probabilistic models,,"Generating large amounts of semantically-rich data for testing big data workflows is paramount for scalable performance benchmarking and quality assurance in modern machine-learning and analytics workloads. The most obvious use case for such a generative algorithm is in conjunction with a big data application blueprint, which can be used by developers (to test their emerging big data solutions) as well as end users (as a starting point for validating infrastructure installations, building novel applications, and learning analytics methods). We present a new domain-driven, generative data model for BigPetStore, a big data application blueprint for the Hadoop ecosystem included in the Apache BigTop distribution. We describe the model and demonstrate its ability to generate semantically-rich data at variable scale ranging from a single machine to a large cluster. We validate the model by using the generated data to answer questions about customer locations and purchasing habits for a fictional targeted advertising campaign, a common business use case."
An Initial Study of Predictive Machine Learning Analytics on Large Volumes of Historical Data for Power System Applications,Big Data; machine learning; Hadoop; Apache Spark,,"Nowadays large volumes of industrial data are being actively generated and collected in various power system applications. Industrial Analytics in the power system field requires more powerful and intelligent machine learning tools, strategies, and environments to properly analyze the historical data and extract predictive knowledge. This paper discusses the situation and limitations of current approaches, analytic models, and tools utilized to conduct predictive machine learning analytics for very large volumes of data where the data processing causes the processor to run out of memory. Two industrial analytics cases in the power systems field are presented. Our results indicated the feasibility of forecasting substations fault events and power load using machine learning algorithm written in MapReduce paradigm or machine learning tools specific for Big Data."
Big Learning Data Analytics Support for Engineering Career Readiness,Learning analytics; career readiness; community of practice; Big Data,5-FACTOR MODEL; PERSONALITY; PERFORMANCE; SUCCESS,"21st Century education develops professional competencies such as lifelong learning, critical thinking and creativity. Learning analytics (LA) and Big Data approaches are emerging to discover readiness patterns of higher education learners towards embracing these competences. To supplement formal education into building these career-oriented habits, a portal application is proposed by feeding data streams gathered from learners throughout their higher-education lifetime, into an analytics engine that reveals levels of professional competencies achievement and tells learners how to increase their career readiness. Big Data techniques are used to gather and cluster data streams, whereas LA techniques examine these data to derive levels of career readiness, which guide higher education learners into a successful career path. The proposed methodology starts by defining and validating standard career disposition criteria inspired from education psychology literature. These intangible disposition indicators and other career-oriented data are stored in a data warehouse for further aggregation and analysis, to evaluate similarities among career patterns and to cluster individuals whose career prospects are deemed similar, into a community of practice (CoP). We synthesize this novel online social structure as a result of the proposed portal processes to augment formal education with a virtual learning environment. This informal classroom-like structure is supervised by a professional mentor to bridge diverse viewpoints and instill a joint effort to leverage future workforce developments. CoP also provides indicators and means to intervene in order to positively affect career readiness."
An Approachable Analytical Study on Big Educational Data Mining,Big Data; Educational Data; Educational Data Mining; Data Mining; Analytical Study,BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; ASSOCIATION RULES; EXCEPTION RULES; SYSTEMS; BEHAVIOR,"The persistent growth of data in education continues. More institutes now store terabytes and even petabytes of educational data. Data complexity in education is increasing as people store both structured data in relational format and unstructured data such as Word or PDF files, images, videos and geospatial data. Indeed learning developers, universities, and other educational sectors confirm that tremendous amount of data captured is in unstructured or semi-structured format. Educators, students, instructors, tutors, research developers and people who deal with educational data are also challenged by the velocity of different data types, organizations as well as institutes that process streaming data such as click streams from web sites, need to update data in real time to serve the right advert or present the right offers to their customers. This analytical study is oriented to the challenges and analysis with big educational data involved with uncovering or extracting knowledge from large data sets by using different educational data mining approaches and techniques."
OPENINGUPSLOVENIA - NATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION ENVIRONMENT FOR OPEN EDUCATION,ICT; information technologies for education; open education; OER; big data in education; learning analytics; automatic translation and transcriptions,,"Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of digital distance learning tools such as Open Educational Resources (OERs) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), all of which present traditional education systems and structures with exciting new opportunities, but also some challenges. Properly exploited, these new resources thus have a huge amount to offer: they can promote knowledge-sharing and intercultural communication; they can broaden access to education, by enabling teaching and learning to take place virtually anywhere; and in their ability to reach large numbers of learners, including by creating virtual communities of common interest, they can increase cost-efficiency. Furthermore, by their very nature they can promote innovation in education and new methodologies. At a broader level, the EU is in danger of lagging behind other regions of the world in this field. Therefore there is a need for thinking out of the box and try to create large scale and nationwide research and testing environments."
Big Data for Enhanced Learning Analytics: A Case for Large-Scale Comparative Assessments,Bigdata; TEL; Learning Analytics; Comparative assessments,,"Recent attention on the potentiality of cost-effective infrastructures for capturing and processing large amounts of data, known as Big Data has received much attention from researchers and practitioners on the field of analytics. In this paper we discuss on the possible benefits that Big Data can bring on TEL by using the case of large scale comparative assessments as an example. Large scale comparative assessments can pose as an intrinsic motivational tool for enhancing the performance of both learners and teachers, as well as becoming a support tool for policy makers. We argue why data from learning processes can be characterized as Big Data from the viewpoint of data source heterogeneity (variety) and discuss some architectural issues that can be taken into account on implementing such an infrastructure on the case of comparative assessments."
Investigation of Students' Attitudes to Lectures with Text-Analysis of Questionnaires,Text Mining; Correspondence Analysis; Free Description Questionnaire; Educational Data Mining; Lecture Data Analysis,,"The eventual goal of our study is to help teachers who give lectures in universities and other educational organizations with advising them as well as to help the attending students in order to maximize the learning performance of student. In order to achieve this goal we take the model-based approach. We construct student's learning model at first, and then extract appropriate tips on teaching for teachers and on learning for students. In this paper, as an attempt in this approach, we analyze the text data which were obtained as answers to a term-end questionnaire in a course. Firstly we make a grouping of students based on a correspondence analysis of students and words from the answers to a question about the student's achievement in taking the course. Then we compare these student groups in combination with other data such as examination scores as achievement, and attendance and homework scores as effort, as well as the features of words used in the answered texts. We have found that the students who have good achievement scores often give the comments from a wider view than what they actually learned in the class. On the other hand the students who give the comments using those terms which were taught in the class tends to have low achievement scores. The methods for in-depth analysis used in this paper are supposed to be appropriate tools for complementing the results from using the big data analysis methods and need to be developed more toward the future."
Continuous Clustering in Big Data Learning Analytics,Big Data; Learning Analytics; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based Clustering; Hadoop; K-Means Clustering,,"Learners' attainment of academic knowledge in postsecondary institutions is predominantly expressed by summative or formative assessment approaches. Recent advances in educational technology has hinted at a means to measure learning efficiency, in terms of personalization of learner competency and capacity in terms of adaptability of observed practices, using raw data observed from study experiences of learners as individuals and as contributors in social networks. While accurate computational models that embody learning efficiency remain a distant and elusive goal, big data learning analytics approaches this goal by recognizing competency growth of learners, at various levels of granularity, using a combination of continuous, formative and summative assessments. This study discusses a method to continuously capture data from students' learning interactions. Then, it analyzes and clusters the data based on their individual performances in terms of accuracy, efficiency and quality by employing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm."
Using Micro-Patterns of Speech to Predict the Correctness of Answers to Mathematics Problems: An Exercise in Multimodal Learning Analytics,Design for learning; multi-modal learning analytics; complex learning environments; systemic functional linguistics; CPACS (The Collaborative Process Analysis Coding Scheme),,"Learning analytics techniques are traditionally used on the 'big data' collected at the course or university level. The application of such techniques to the data sets generated in complex learning environments can provide insights into the relationships between the design of learning environments, the processes of learning, and learning outcomes. In this paper, two of the codes described as part of the Collaborative Process Analysis Coding Scheme (CPACS) were extracted from the Math Data Corpus. The codes selected were tense and pronouns, both of which have been found to indicate phases of group work and the action associated with collaboration. Rather than examine these measures of social interactions in isolation, a framework for the analysis of complex learning environments was applied. This facilitated an analysis of the relationships between the social interactions, the task design and learning outcomes, as well as tool use. The generation of a successful problem solution of one expert and one non-expert group was accurately predicted (75%-94%). The examination of interactions between the social, epistemic and tool elements of the learning environment for one group showed that successful role differentiation and participation were related to successful problem solutions in the first meeting. In the second meeting, these were less important. The relationship between the discourse related to problem resolution through action and the correctness of a problems solution was found to be less reliable measures, however further analysis is needed at a finer grain to investigate this finding. A rich description of the processes of learning (with regards to social interaction, generation of knowledge, and discourse related to action) was generated for one group."
BIG DATA & LEARNING ANALYTICS: A POTENTIAL WAY TO OPTIMIZE ELEARNING TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS,Learning Analytics; Big Data; Technological Elearning Tools; Learning Management System; Educational Data Mining.,,"In the information age, one of the most influential institutions is education. The recent emergence of MOOCS is a sample of the new expectations that are offered to university students. Basing decisions on data and evidence seems obvious, and indeed, research indicates that data-driven decision-making improves organizational productivity. The most dramatic factor shaping the future of higher education is Big Data and analytics. Big Data emphasizes that the data itself is a path to value generation in organizations and it is, also, a critical value for higher education institutions. The emerging practice of academic analytics is likely to become a new useful tool for a new era. Analytics and big data have a significant role to play in the future of higher education. This paper attempts an analytical practice about the use of e-learning technological tools to generate relevant information, for the teacher and the students who try to optimize their learning process. This combination of data-processing and analytical learning is an aid to improve significantly higher education and mark the path to follow in the new educational era."

In this paper, we present the theoretical background, design, implementation, and evaluation details of eLAT, a Learning Analytics Toolkit, which enables teachers to explore and correlate learning object usage, user properties, user behavior, as well as assessment results based on graphical indicators. The primary aim of the development of eLAT is to process large data sets in microseconds with regard to individual data analysis interests of teachers and data privacy issues, in order to help them to self-reflect on their technology-enhanced teaching and learning scenarios and to identify opportunities for interventions and improvements."
Data mining in topology education: Rough set data analysis,Artificial Intelligence; rough sets; educational data mining; topology,,"This study explores rough sets, which provide mathematical description for uncertain concepts that can not be defined clearly by traditional logic. The study further examines data mining, which helps to discover meaningful information from large data sets by incorporating it with rough set theory. An investigation in topology instruction was undertaken to exemplify the usability of rough set theory in qualitative data analysis. The study provides an example of educational application of data mining in a topology course."
Mining Educational Game Data: Uncovering Complex Mechanisms Behind Learning,data mining; education; games; user modeling,PERFORMANCE,"Data Mining refers to methods to find patterns, dependencies or other meaningful information from large data sets. Common methods for data mining are based on regression analysis, Bayesian models, clustering algorithms and neural networks. Data Mining has been successfully applied in science, business and logistics for years. However, educational Data Mining is relatively young discipline focusing on understanding students' use of interactive learning environments. According to original ideas of Data Mining, there are no hypotheses set in advance: the data will reveal the answers. The study focuses on the process of conceptual change (N = 818) while trying to reveal playing behavior that facilitates it and learning transfer. In the paper we briefly describe the conceptual change approach, data mining methods and our research framework for transfer. Finally, the results of the study are presented and discussed. The main result is a finding that difficulties in understanding different numbering systems are mediated by fraction numbers with odd numbered nominators. These results show the strengths of Educational Data Mining: we could point out difficulties and their backgrounds, which would not have been found without mining approach."
