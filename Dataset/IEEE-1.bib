abstract={Data with high volume, velocity, variety and veracity brings the new experience curve of analytics. Big data in higher education comes from different sources that include blogs, social networks, student information systems, learning management systems, research, and other machine-generated data. Once the data is analysed it promises better student placement processes; more accurate enrolment forecasts, and early warning systems that identify and assist students at-risk of failing or dropping out. Big data is becoming a key to creating competitive advantages in higher education. Like with any organization, traditional data processing and analysis of structured and unstructured data using RDBMS and data warehousing no longer satisfy big data challenges. The lack of adequate conceptual architectures for big data tailored for institutions of higher education has led to many failures to produce meaningful, accessible, and timely information for decision making. Therefore, this calls for the development of conceptual architectures for big data in higher education. This paper presents an architecture for big data analytics in higher education.},

abstract={Learning analytics is the art and science of collecting, analyzing and reporting data about learners and their learning environments in order to better understand and optimize the learning process and its environment. It is closely associated to educational data mining. Machine learning, data mining and human computer interaction techniques are used to the data collected about learners and their interactions. It aims at leveraging the learning process and learners' experience through the use of ubiquitous sensor based infrastructure, increased collection of large and diverse set of data, and subsequently applying machine learning and data analytics could really make it useful. Big data principles can be also very helpful to solve the mysteries related to the collection, storage management and analysis of large and heterogeneous set of data. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a more structured literature review process. It also provides more thorough coverage of the literature thereby minimizing the research bias. This paper aims at developing a systematic literature review protocol for the learning analytics to highlight the applications, issues and challenges, existing solutions and future directions in the context of big data.},

abstract={All organizations are working nowadays in a very dynamic and strongly competitive environment. In order to survive and remain competitive, they need to take timely, adequate and informed decisions that are based not only on intuition and past experience. The main challenges for data analysis are related with the specific characteristics of “big data” and the availability of suitable analytical tools for knowledge extraction that would support the processes of taking strategic management decisions. While “big data” are already widely available and used in business, there are only rare cases of utilizing “big data” in the educational sector. The main purpose of this paper is to focus on the challenges related to the analytical processing of “big data” generated and stored at higher education institutions. The paper discusses the unique opportunities that Big Data analysis could give for the educational sector development and the improvements that could scale from a single school, to governmental directions and satisfaction of the labor market. However, big data analytics confronts universities with great challenges as well, related to finding appropriate methods and tools for extracting knowledge and patterns from extremely rich and complex data sets, and integrating the insights into a coherent vision for strategic management decisions.},

abstract={To ensure transparency and provide ways for analysis and auditing of various public activities and expenditures, the Complementary Law 131, known as the "Transparency Law," requires the Union, States, and Cities to disclose their expenses in real-time through Internet. However, despite the apparent progress in opening data in Brazil, applications do not follow the various recommended models. Since this data is mostly unconnected, a clear view of the underlying contexts of a query becomes impossible. Thus, there is no clear relationship between recorded expenditure data for education, quality indicators, and/or descriptive census data. The following research sought to create relations between data from the Brazilian Federal Government Open Data Portal and the primary education quality indicator, IDEB, in the cities of the state. The methodology used was Data Mining, a research field resulting from the intersection between the areas of Computer Science and statistics, which seeks to discover non-trivial information hidden in large data. Using Correlation and Linear Regression in the collected and formatted data, it was not found linear relationship, indicating that only cities funding data is not sufficient to obtain a causal relationship with the IDEB average for municipalities. The statistical result found, although it does not provide a direct correlation between the variables investigated, represents a relevant scientific finding in the non-causal relationship itself. The more relevant contribution of this research is the process of selection, preprocessing, and transformation of the data scattered in different information sources and different formats of the analyzed data, as well as the originality of the analyzed causality.},

These devices provide data that are traces of the activities of students or teachers. The data produced are cognitive information of very fine levels (student knowledge, skills, and errors) and require specific analysis and processing tools, we talk here about educational data mining methods, Educational data processing (EDM) is rising as a notion of research and analysis with a set of machine and psychological ways and research approaches for understanding however students learn. EDM uses machine approaches to research instructional knowledge so as to review instructional queries. For this knowledge exploration, several tools were used like personal learning environments, recommender systems, Context learning, and Course management systems. These tools offer numerous edges for instructional data processing. In this survey, we have a tendency to focus and supply numerous tools of analysis trends exploitation EDM Tools to explore data and knowledge, and explaining the process of EDM application, the goal is not only to transform the data into knowledge but also to filter the extracted knowledge to know how to modify the educational environment to improve learners' learning. This paper surveys the foremost relevant studies administrated during this field up to date.},

abstract={Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an area of growing interest in academia with significant challenges and tremendous opportunities. Most EDM initiatives are based on finding patterns to aid and enhance student learning and performance, while others focus on program efficiency, service improvement, and college readiness. This paper is related to a case study being conducted at Sta. Teresa School, a high school in the Northern District of a West African country looking to improve service quality. By combining its Relational Database School Management System data sets with its anticipated online community forum, and aggregating it with Social media data, the school is expected to gain new actionable insights to enhance student services. In this paper, we present a model for incorporating privacy into big data analytics architecture integration with Social media, discuss some of the school's concern related to privacy and security, and offer some delivery options for its online community forum initiative.},

abstract={During the learning process, more and more data is generated, called big data, which includes a variety of data about students and the learning process. These data represent the “footprints” that students “leave” when they interact with an increasingly complex and rapidly changing learning environment. The abundance of data leads to an increasing interest in the use of methods of analytics of educational data (Education Data Mining, EDM) of researchers, teachers and practitioners in the field of academic education. In the process of educational activity, students are constantly faced with an overabundance of information resources. Large amounts of information in a formalized, formalized-algorithmized form lead to an uncontrolled increase in cognitive load in the educational process. In order to manage the learning process, it is necessary in a short time to obtain information about the individual characteristics of the cognitive and mental activity of students in order to reconfigure the educational content, adapt the process to a particular student to reduce the negative effect. In this report, the application of EDM technology in training systems and their prospects is discusses.},

abstract={Growing interest in educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) to leverage big data and to benefit education and the science of learning has made data ownership an important focus point for institutions and students. While EDM and LA can provide important information that help enhance the quality of teaching and learning, it has become critical to ensure data privacy and student agency over data. In this paper, we introduce Kratos: an immutable and publicly verifiable data management system that enables EDM and LA, while maintaining data privacy and empowering students with a user interface for data governance and participation in school processes. The system aims to achieve data interoperability, which facilitates EDM and LA as incentives to educational stakeholders (policy makers, educators, developers of education technologies, etc.), while prioritizing student agency over their data. Our system gives students and schools an immutable log along with comprehensive access to data that is otherwise scattered across systems and vendors. The underlying set of rules of the system are defined in a set of smart contracts, codified from existing non-virtual agreements [1] between schools and education technology (edutech) vendors. We propose the smart contracts to be deployed on a public blockchain (like Ethereum or Bitcoin), for notarizing and time-stamping various interactions which users of Kratos may have with data. Third parties requesting access to school data have a unique virtual token assigned to them on the blockchain which helps keep track of data modifications, access and use.},

abstract={Business intelligence (BI) builds upon a set of tools and applications that enable the analysis of vast amounts of information (Big Data). Educational institutions handle large volumes of Big Data every year. There is a strong need for the use of BI in these institutions to improve their processes and support decision making.

The DW will be used in a knowledge discovery process to handle the information for the analysis of key performance indicators using educational data mining (EDM) techniques. The DW along with an enterprise architecture (EA) repository are the key technological assets of a knowledge management framework (KMF). This framework was designed to put order in the creation, capture, transfer and digitalization of knowledge. This guide and the framework are two of the outcomes of a research project in a private university. Furthermore, a case study suggests how to choose the best methodology in higher institutions. In the case study the steps for the DW design are presented. This study can be useful for academics and practitioners that plan to design a DW to analyze information using EDM techniques.},

abstract={Education system is one of the sectors that experiences changes in terms of technological innovations. Many institutions adopt the use of e-learning platforms and other web services for interactions of the students. Numerous users keep logging into these applications which resulted into supplying huge amount of data. However, despite these huge amount of data, institutions are yet to make use of most of these data. They tend to manage the data submitted by the users regarding their requests only while ignoring data related to web behavioral inputs. Therefore, this paper aimed at providing a model for enhancing teaching and learning in educational institutes using big data technology. The paper has objectives as to identify benefits of big data technology in education, to describe the applications of big data in education and finally to provide big data models for educational system. The paper uses both survey and modelling approaches, the survey makes use of review papers to outline the benefits and applications of big data into education, while the modelling approach uses unified modelling language (UML) to provide description on small data and big data interactions in education system. The small data provide traditional feedback with emphasis on students' performance only, while the big data measures the entire learning process consisting of both students and teachers.},

abstract={In the recent years, big data and learning analytics have been emerging as fast-growing research fields. The application of these emerging research areas is gradually addressing the contemporary challenges of school and university education. Tracing out the information regarding students' misconceptions and dropping-out probabilities from the courses at the right instant of time, development of detectors of a range of educational importance and achieving the highest level of quality in the higher education are becoming more challenging. Moreover, providing well timed and the best suitable solutions to the students at-risk are even more strenuous. In this concept paper, we aim to address these contemporary challenges of school and the university education and their probable solutions by utilizing our research experiences of automated assessment, immediate feedback, learning analytics and the IT technologies. Solving such problems by knowing the history of students' activities, submissions, and the performances data is possible. The identification of students' misconceptions during the learning process, examining behavioral patterns and significant trends by efficiently aggregating and correlating the massive data, improving the state-of-the-art skills in creative thinking and innovation, and detecting the drop-outs on-time are highlighted in this article. We are aiming at extracting such knowledge so that adaptive and personalized learning will become a part of the current education system. Not only the available algorithm of supervised learning methods such as support vector machine, neural network, decision trees, discriminant analysis, and nearest neighborhood method but also new engineering and distillation of relevant data features can be carried out to solve these educational challenges.},

abstract={Both educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) focus on applying analytics and data mining techniques to extract useful information from large data sets. EDM is generally more interested in automated methods for discovery within the educational data while LA is relatively keen on applying human-led methods to understand the involved learning processes. Among the various fields of challenging studies in EDM, domain structure discovery is aimed to find the structure of knowledge in an educational domain, such as formulating the prerequisite requirements among various knowledge components through online educational resources. However, with the vast amount of knowledge components in specific subjects, the process of such formulation is very complicated and time-consuming no matter being done manually or semi-automatically. In this work, we propose a systematic framework of a semi-supervised learning approach in which a concept-based classifier is co-trained with an explicit semantic analysis (ESA) classifier to derive a common set of prerequisite rules based on a diverse set of online educational resources. To demonstrate its feasibility, a working prototype is built with some impressive results obtained in specific engineering subjects. More importantly, our proposal sheds light on many possible directions for future exploration.},

The creation of open datasets can speed up research advancements by allowing researchers to focus efforts on developing and validating analytical techniques, rather than on obtaining data. Open datasets also allow researchers to benchmark new analytical approaches against a known standard, and increase the reproducibility of research. The field of higher education learning analytics could benefit from the creation of open, shared datasets on higher education students as these data do not currently exist in open and accessible formats. Here, we propose the use of synthetic data generators to create open access versions of student data. Synthetic datasets have an advantage over real data, as private student data is protected by federal laws. We compare the characteristics of the synthetic data to the original data and illustrate a model for how the synthetic data can be leveraged for developing and optimizing a common learning analytics algorithm.},

However, there has been a limited interest in the adoption big data and analytics in institutions of HE. The lack of interest in big data and analytics from HE institutions has caused institutions to function with substantial delays in analysing readily evident data. Furthermore, the lack of adequate theoretical frameworks for IS adoption in HE institutions has steered the many failures to produce meaningful, accessible and timely information for decision making.

abstract={Advances in science and technology, the Internet of Things, and the proliferation of mobile apps are critical factors to the current increase in the amount, structure, and size of information that organizations have to store, process, and analyze. Traditional data storages present technical deficiencies when handling huge volumes of data and are not adequate for process modeling and business intelligence; to cope with these deficiencies, new methods and technologies have been developed under the umbrella of big data. However, there is still the need in higher education institutions (HEIs) of a technological tool that can be used for big data processing and knowledge management (KM). To overcome this issue, it is essential to develop an information infrastructure that allows the capturing of knowledge and facilitates experimentation by having cleaned and consistent data. Thus, this paper presents a hybrid information infrastructure for business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and KM based on an educational data warehouse (EDW) and an enterprise architecture (EA) repository that allows the digitization of knowledge and empowers the visualization and the analysis of dissimilar organizational components as people, processes, and technology. The proposed infrastructure was created based on research and will serve to run different experiments to analyze educational data and academic processes and for the creation of explicit knowledge using different algorithms and methods of educational data mining, learning analytics, online analytical processing (OLAP), and EA analytics.},

abstract={Big Data is becoming an integral part of education system worldwide, bringing in so much of prediction potential and therefore opportunities to improve learning and teaching methodologies. In fact, it has become the digital policy instrument for policy makers to make strategic decisions supported by big data analytics. This paper uses Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to establish a general overview and background in establishing gaps that need to be addressed in big data analytics for education landscape. A total of 59 research papers from 473 papers were chosen and analyzed. There is an increased trend in incorporating big data in education however, it is not sufficient and need more research in this area particularly predictive models and frameworks for educational settings.},

abstract={The adoption of e-learning systems in higher education is a remarkable phenomenon that has redefined teaching and learning. Initially, it was proposed to allow people to learn for personal accomplishment without physically attending any traditional university or academic settings. While these systems continue to provide an efficient and flexible approach for teaching and learning, the rapid integration of ICTs and the expansion of data from these systems remain much concern to the education community. In this study, we propose a smart and secure data flow architectural framework for e-learning that uses a rich set of big data tools within a distributed and parallel analysis platform. Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) reference model guided the development of this Big Data framework for e-learning analytics. Using the RM-ODP model as a benchmark, we classify the educational institution's architecture in terms of existing elements, functions and processes to understand stakeholders' views for the development of the framework. Our approach uses an existing distributed computing environment and offers an adaptable standard framework to improve the data acquisition, storage, processing, analysis, security and virtualization for e-learning systems. We implement a scalable and adaptable big data framework for e-learning (BiDeL) and point out how big data concept could integrate into online learning systems to improve teaching and learning in higher education using Apache Spark as a case. The proposed framework was applied to both batch and streaming dataset of students online activities on moodle LMSs. BiDel framework performance shows improved data integration and data governance. This big data framework and the general view of the current state of the art in “big data” technologies will serve as a guide for the creation of e-learning systems, which create new value from existing but underused data. The acquired value will provide decision-makers in higher education with new insights from data to enhance productivity in teaching and learning. These insights can lead to innovation, competitiveness in the academic space and even create entirely new teaching and learning models.},

pages={160-171},
abstract={The technology-push of die stacking and application pull of Big Data machine learning analytics (BMLA) have created a unique opportunity for processing-near-memory (PNM). This paper makes four contributions: (1) While previous PNM work explores general MapReduce workloads, we identify three application characteristics of most BMLAs: (a) irregular-and-compute-light (i.e., perform only a few operations per input word which include data-dependent branches and indirect memory accesses); (b) compact (i.e., the relevant portion of the input data and the intermediate live data for each thread are small); and (c) memory-row-dense (i.e., process the input data without skipping over many bytes). These characteristics, except for irregularity, are necessary for bandwidth-and energy-efficient PNM, irrespective of the architecture. (2) Based on these characteristics, we propose memory optimizations for a "sea of simple MIMD cores (SSMC)" PNM architecture, called Millipede, which (pre) fetches and operates on entire memory rows to exploit BMLAs' row-density. Instead of this row-oriented access and compute-schedule, traditional multicores opportunistically improve row locality while fetching and operating on cache blocks. (3) Millipede employs well-known MIMD execution to handle BMLAs' irregularity, and sequential prefetch of input data to hide memory latency. In Millipede, however, one corelet prefetches a row for all the corelets which may stray far from each other due to their MIMD execution. Consequently, a leading corelet may prematurely evict the prefetched data before a lagging corelet has consumed the data. Millipede employs cross-corelet flow-control to prevent such eviction. (4) Millipede further exploits its flow-controlled prefetch for frequency scaling based on coarse-grain compute-memory rate-matching which decreases (increases) the processor clock speed when the prefetch buffers are empty (full). Using simulations, we compare PNM architectures to show that Millipede improves performance and energy, by 135% and 27% over a GPGPU with prefetch, and by 35% and 36% over SSMC with prefetch, when all three PNM architectures use the same resources (i.e., number of cores and on-processor-die memory) and identical die-stacking.},

abstract={E Learning courses are much in demand in recent times. The need to study student's performance and predicting their performance is increasing along with it. With the growing popularity of educational technology, various data mining algorithms suitable for predicting student performance have been reviewed. The best algorithm depends on the nature of prediction the faculty wants to make. As the amount of student data is increasing the need to address the complexities of data relation and their processing is a challenge to find the student at risk of failing. This paper covers the Decision Tree Approach for Predictive Analytics of student's performance and its Big Data Implication.},

abstract={Data mining is a process of finding anomalies, implicit patterns, and correlations within large data sets to predict outcomes, or in other words, the search for relationships and global patterns that exist, but are `hidden' among the vast amounts of data. When applied to the educational domain, data mining is a powerful tool that enables better understanding of relationships, structure, patterns, and causal pathways which provide students the cognitive strategies to think critically, make decisions, and solve problems. The talk will discuss the methodology and results of this research, present the extracted knowledge, and describe its importance in the teaching-learning space. Recent developments engineered to capture and store non-cognitive affective-domain features, such as interest and persistence will be addressed. The objective is evidence-centered design and the data mining framework acknowledges that assessments entail different levels of confidence and risk.},

abstract={Learning Analytics (LA) has become a prominent paradigm in the context of education lately which adopts the recent advancements of technology such as cloud computing, big data processing, and Internet of Things. LA also requires an intensive amount of processing resources to generate relevant analytical results. However, the traditional approaches have been inefficient at tackling LA challenges such as real-time, high performance, and scalable processing of heterogeneous datasets and streaming data. An Internet of Things (IoT) scalable, distributed and high performance framework has the potential to address mentioned LA challenges by efficient contextualization of data. In this paper, CoALA, a Smart Learning Analytics conceptual model is proposed to improve the effectiveness of LA by utilizing an IoT-based contextualization framework in terms of performance, scalability, and efficiency.},

abstract={Analytics is all about insights. Learning-oriented insights are the targets for Learning Analytics researchers. Insights could be detected, analysed, or created in the context of variables such as the quality of interactions with the content, study habits, engagement, competence growth, sentiments, learning efficiency, and instructional effectiveness. Clustering techniques offer an effective solution for grouping learners using observed patterns. For instance, learners could be clustered based on the effectiveness of learners' self-regulation initiatives in reaching the target learning outcomes. Each learner could belong to a number of clusters that target different types of insights. One could also analyse the distance between clusters as a means to guide learners towards better performance. Further, one could analyse the effectiveness of cohesive peer groups within and among clusters. Traditional clustering techniques only cope with numerical or categorical data and are not readily applicable in offering learning analytics solutions. In addressing this gap, this research aims to design a Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO) algorithm for the purposes of learning analytics, where the arrival of data is continuous, the types of data is both structured and unstructured, and the volume of data can be significantly large. The research will also describe the application of the PPSO algorithm to detect, analyse, and generate learning-oriented insights.},

abstract={Big Data technology is a generic technology, which can be applied to any real-world problem that involves a lot of data. Moreover, the use of cloud-based infrastructure to implement the big data technology makes it a cost-effective solution to the big data problem. One of the fundamental sectors that can benefit from this technology is education and research. The education system can use big data analytics to provide better education and administer the institutional operations. Research, which is an extension of education, can use analytics of big scholar data, for diverse applications, to facilitate research at the individual, team and organization level. With that said, the practical implementation and adoption of big data for education and research, collectively referred to as `Educational Intelligence', faces several challenges, particularly in a developing country like India. This research paper explores how cloud-based big data analytics can be applied to Indian education and research and reviews the challenges that need to be addressed before the true benefits of this technology can be obtained.},

abstract={Learning analytics (LA) is a promising tool to support learning and retention in studies; so far, many applications have been developed to make use of big data saved automatically while using online learning management systems. However, it is not clear how different applications support the contemporary learning approach or how they are valued by both teachers and students. Therefore, a qualitative study was conducted to explore university teachers' and students' expectations on LA. Several scenarios were provided to them in order to feed their ideas about the potential of LA. The results were linked to the characteristics of the contemporary learning approach. This showed that while self-regulation is the most often supported objective enhanced by LA, collaboration skills and subjective well-being need much more attention. It was also found that students were more positive than teachers in starting to use LA and teachers' opinions varied greatly.},

abstract={The rapid expansion of information and communication technologies in relation to big data analysis generates the vital demand to gain the maximum benefit of the 'big data'. Business intelligence and learning analytics are recently drawing considerable attention in market and society being one of the most competitive and profitable areas of interest to businesses and organizations, including higher education institutions. Business intelligence systems have already demonstrated significant impact on strategic decision making and trends forecasting. Learning analytics is going to extend the value of business intelligence in the field of education and training in proportion to retention, students' success and satisfaction. Hence, the overall organization's performance and ranking -in a wider scope-will be transformed toward informed, timelier, high-valued, evidenced and high-quality decisions benefiting the students, and accordingly, achieving sustainable organization's performance in a middle term, and society advancement in a longer term. This paper focuses on investigating the potential of business intelligence approaches toward a meaningful analysis of the organization's and student's experience by making use of business intelligence enhanced learning analytics. It provides valuable insights into the integration and use of business intelligence in the learning analytics application area by highlighting recent research and developments. Furthermore, it suggests paths to resolving current issues in the interrelationship between higher education institutions' and learning performance by designing a novel closed-loop feedback framework that aims at improving the learning outcomes for the students, and the organization, and prepares for smart educational management.},

Recent advances in educational technology has hinted at a means to measure learning efficiency, in terms of personalization of learner competency and capacity in terms of adaptability of observed practices, using raw data observed from study experiences of learners as individuals and as contributors in social networks. While accurate computational models that embody learning efficiency remain a distant and elusive goal, big data learning analytics approaches this goal by recognizing competency growth of learners, at various levels of granularity, using a combination of continuous, formative and summative assessments. This study discusses a method to continuously capture data from students' learning interactions.

As such, this paper explores educational data mining techniques alongside some of the emerging learning analytics with the objective of gaining insight into some of the common learning behaviors among students. The task at hand embraces predictive analytics and it employs decision trees, neural networks, and Naïve Bayes algorithms to classify and cluster student learning patterns that can explain academic performance. Predictive analytics has emerged as one of the tools furthering adaptive learning among other lifechanging novelties. Nonetheless, integration of big data in academia is in its infancy although the western hemisphere is making progress towards the integration. Such progress will increase the relevance of data mining in education and this paper envisages to be among the first ones to address the applicability of machine learning in improving education.

Recommendation systems are already very helpful in e-commerce, service industry and social networking sites. Recently recommendation systems are proved to be efficient for education sector as well. In this work we are using recommendation system for Big data in education. This work uses collaborative filtering based recommendation techniques to recommend elective courses to students, depending upon their grade points obtained in other subjects. We are using item based recommendation of Mahout machine learning library on top of Hadoop to generate set of recommendations. Similarity Log-likelihood is used to discover patterns among grades and subjects. Root Mean Square Error between actual grade and recommended grade is used to test the recommendation system. The output of this study can be used by schools, colleges or universities to suggest alternative elective courses to students.},

abstract={MOOC aims at delivering online courses to tens of thousands to millions of heterogeneous learners at the same time, with minimal or no charge. It provides an alternate way to disseminate quality education to the section of people who cannot reach premier institutions. It has great potential to overcome the barriers of traditional learning systems. However, there are several challenges in MOOCs such as huge drop-out rates, improper automated assessments, varied student engagement, and attention etc. Learning Analytics helps us to contain such issues. Learning analytics, with the help of Big Data Technologies, helps us to interpret humongous MOOCs data to assess progress, predict performance and identify problems. To perform analytics, we developed a workflow using Apache Spark, a scalable inmemory computing framework. The data from edX platform has been used for experiments. It contains the information of more than 2 Lakh students from 39 courses. Initially, detailed statistical analysis has been carried out to understand the learning patterns and the behavior of online learners. Later, we have developed drop-out prediction models using various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Logistic Regression. A stacked ensemble model is developed and performance comparison with baseline models is carried out. It outperformed all other models with an accuracy of 91.2%.},

abstract={Computer-supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is a pedagogical strategy associated with how learners construct knowledge with a group by computer-based learning system. In recent years, most of the computer-based learning systems record the interaction log of each learner when developing course assignments. However, the recorded data is facing a challenge to expose the learners behaviors during the course and to design a computer-supported collaborative learning activity. To address those challenges in this paper, a novel collaborative programming tool called Software Project Development and Insight Learning Environment (SPDI Learning Environment) is described. The SPDI Learning environment allows learners of computer science to develop course assignments collaboratively. Besides, it allows instructors to investigate the learners behaviors by associating a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) with Big Data analysis pipeline and Visualization Dashboard. In addition to collect real data from courses, we designed learning activities to help teachers to engage the field of CSCL and Learning Analytics.},

abstract={Presently, educational institutions compile and store huge volumes of data, such as student enrolment and attendance records, as well as their examination results. Mining such data yields stimulating information that serves its handlers well. Rapid growth in educational data points to the fact that distilling massive amounts of data requires a more sophisticated set of algorithms. This issue led to the emergence of the field of educational data mining (EDM). Traditional data mining algorithms cannot be directly applied to educational problems, as they may have a specific objective and function. This implies that a preprocessing algorithm has to be enforced first and only then some specific data mining methods can be applied to the problems. One such preprocessing algorithm in EDM is clustering. Many studies on EDM have focused on the application of various data mining algorithms to educational attributes. Therefore, this paper provides over three decades long (1983-2016) systematic literature review on clustering algorithm and its applicability and usability in the context of EDM. Future insights are outlined based on the literature reviewed, and avenues for further research are identified.},

abstract={This paper proposes an approach for developing curriculum-level open student models. This approach entails evaluating student core competencies using the correspondence between courses and core competencies in a competency-based curriculum and students' taken courses and grades. On the basis of this approach, a curriculum-level, competency-based visualized analytic system, called visualized analytics of core competencies (VACCs), was implemented. Course-competency diagnostic tools, course work performance radar charts, and peer-based ranking tables were developed as part of the VACC analytic system for student reflection and to position their levels of core competencies. These curriculum-level open student models revealed multiple aspects of students' core competencies by monitoring the quantity and quality of courses taken by students, and evaluating students' ranks regarding core competencies compared with their classmates and graduates. VACC evaluation was conducted in this paper. The results showed that more than 70% of students reported that VACC helped in reflecting on their core competencies, assisting them in understanding the correspondence between their taken courses and core competencies, and helping them to set goals regarding taking additional courses. In addition, this paper discusses potential analytics and applications of open student models of core competencies.},

abstract={Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) systems, understood as those that exploit multimodal evidence of learning to better model a learning situation, have not yet spread widely in educational practice. Their inherent technical complexity, and the lack of educational stakeholder involvement in their design, are among the hypothesized reasons for the slow uptake of this emergent field. To aid in the process of stakeholder communication and systematization leading to the specification of MMLA systems, this paper proposes a Multimodal Data Value Chain (M-DVC). This conceptual tool, derived from both the field of Big Data and the needs of MMLA scenarios, has been evaluated in terms of its usefulness for stakeholders, in three authentic case studies of MMLA systems currently under development. The results of our mixed-methods evaluation highlight the usefulness of the M-DVC to elicit unspoken assumptions or unclear data processing steps in the initial stages of development. The evaluation also revealed limitations of the M-DVC in terms of the technical terminology employed, and the need for more detailed contextual information to be included. These limitations also prompt potential improvements for the M-DVC, on the path towards clearer specification and communication within the multi-disciplinary teams needed to build educationally-meaningful MMLA solutions.},

Background: Over last few years, Big Data has been one of the most demanded technologies by companies in any field. In order to fill this need of Big Data professionals, Universities must create new degrees or update existing degrees so that their graduated students are ready to perform this job. For this, the Degree in Computer Engineering of our University, which is taught totally online, has been updated to include Big Data technologies. These technologies are included in a databases course. Intended outcomes: The proposal allows faculty from any university worldwide to keep degrees up-to-date with minimal administrative effort. Application design: Big Data technologies have been included in a practical exercise, since deeper modifications in the course would require a lot administrative of effort. This work presents this exercise focusing on the learning objectives it pursues. Findings: A number of dimensions are analyzed over several academic years, resulting that almost all submitting students have achieved all the learning outcomes of the exercise, the course evaluation and success rates have improved, and students value positively the exercise, the materials, and the knowledge acquired.},

However, by examining the relevant literature it became apparent that the attempts to blend these topics are limited. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a theoretical framework which accounts the elements that influence the educational processes and the unique features that immersive technologies have. On the grounds of this framework, an effort will be made to design and develop a universal LA system which will support the conduct and evaluation of such interventions in different educational contexts and scientific fields.},

The framework described here is designed to cope with these challenges. Firstly it is composed of generic components where the initial stage can transform unstructured image or text data into a set of features for the latter stages. Secondly the machine learning analytics engine incorporates three optimizations which allow the framework to scale and deal with large amounts of unstructured data.

abstract={With the advent of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), the data scale of student learning behavior and knowledge mastery has significantly increased. In order to effectively and efficiently analyze these datasets and present on-the-fly intelligent tutoring to online learners, it is necessary to improve existing learning analytics tools in a parallel and automatic way. One of the most common tools is Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) that can model temporal progress of online learners and evaluate their mastery of course knowledge. Current implementation of BKT is mostly based on single machine, which leads to slow execution performance during its Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm for parameter fitting. Although there are a few parallel implementations for EM algorithm, they don't support automatic initial BKT parameter tuning to ensure the correct convergence of the EM iteration. Therefore, this paper presents a new parallel BKT open source tool based on the Spark computational framework with the method of automatic tuning of initial parameters. This tool improves traditional knowledge tracing systems using a parallel EM algorithm with the capabilty of automatically choosing initial parameters. Experimental result demonstrates that our tool can achieve fast execution speed and greatly improve the accuracy of training parameters on both different sizes of simulated data and real educational data sets.},

However, the development of utilizing Big Data-based algorithms of the next internet generation, the so-called `Internet of Things', leads to a comprehensive approach of personalized learning for very different target groups. Understanding the learner's profile and interests, learning goals and learning difficulties, `intelligent agents' accompany and guide the learner during the learning process in the future. In particular, for students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia and dyscalculia, the new development of `learning analytics' based on Big Data algorithms has a large potential. The goal is to overcome the severe gap between their existing intellectual potentials and their often unsuccessful learning biographies in schools and universities. The changes of daily environments towards a 4.0-Society, in particular through fully networked Smart Cities, result in an increasing number of data from very heterogeneous sources. Due to technologies such as, e.g., smart wearables combined with data generated through traffic and mobility or logistics, smart geographical places will be enabled to act as a basis for intelligent learning and evaluation mechanisms.},

Most literature reviews from a few authors have focused on one of these fields: educational mining, learning analytics with discussions on one or two aspects such as Big data technologies without educational focus, social media data in education, etc. Most of these literature reviews are short and insufficient to provide more inclusive reviews for Big educational data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature review of the current and emerging paradigms for Big educational data. The survey is presented in five parts: (1) The first part presents an overview and classification of Big education research to show the full landscape in this field, which also gives a concise summary of the overall scope of this paper; (2) The second part presents a discussion for the various data sources from education platforms or systems including learning management systems (LMS), massive open online courses (MOOC), learning object repository (LOR), OpenCourseWare (OCW), open educational resources (OER), social media, linked data and mobile learning contributing to Big education data; (3) The third part presents the data collection, data mining and databases in Big education data; (4) The fourth part presents the technological aspects including Big data platforms and architectures such as Hadoop, Spark, Samza and Big data tools for Big education data; and (5) The fifth part presents different approaches of data analytics for Big education data. This part provides a more inclusive discussion on data analytics which is beyond traditional forms of learning analysis in higher education. This includes predictive analytics, learning analytics including collaborative, behavior, personal learnings and assessment, followed by recommendation systems, graph analytics, visual analytics, immersive learning and analytics, etc. The final part of the paper discusses social (e.g. privacy and ethical issues) and technological challenges for Big data in education. This part also illustrates the technological challenges faced by giving an example for utilizing graph-based analytics for a cross-institution learning analytics scenario.},

abstract={The knowledge discovery in the education and training process is very important in terms of raising the quality of the education and training activities. Nowadays, there are a number of applications in the field of education and training that enable giving high-dimensional data such as questionnaires, exam results and guidance tests. It is easier to improve the education and training processes by analyzing data from these large data sets. In this study, a software with graphical interface that can be used in the problem of educational data mining is designed. In addition, this software has been used to estimate the school failure by using data mining methods and to compare the performance of these methods on a data set from the UCI data warehouse.},

abstract={The inclusion of information and communication technologies in Healthcare and Medical Education is a fact nowadays. Furthermore numerous virtual learning environments have been established in order to host both educational material and learners online activities. Online modules in a VLE can be designed in very different ways being part of different types of courses, while different models can be used to design the course based on what the creator aims to achieve. Thus, the types and the importance of the different elements of the online course may vary a lot. At the same time the need of a global approach to gather big educational data in order to provide valid meaning to the data through learning analytics and educational data mining is urgent. In order this to be achievable we propose a Learner Activity Taxonomy in which the different elements of the learners activity data can be categorised and a Learner Engagement Framework in which the importance of the different elements is vital in order for an analysis of the big educational data to provide a meaningful result. The initial application to practice of the Taxonomy and the Framework are presented based on data from 3 modules at 2 Universities, while the impact of them along with its limitations are discussed.},

abstract={In recent years, learning analytics solutions have highly appealed to the higher education community who mainly focuses on improving the learning process, self-regulated learning skills, and learners' success rate. Learning analytics has to deal with continuous data, however, conventional data mining algorithms are not readily applicable to handle the continuous incoming of learners' data. In order to cope with these scenarios, the proposed learning analytics aimed to manage the continuous data, perform the clustering process using the optimization approach, detect the 'at-risk' learners' who are in a course failure situation, and generate signals to learners and teachers. Based on the predicted outcome, the proposed system identifies and adapts the learning activities and learning contents to help learners find their way out of their learning difficulties and course failure situation. The experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed work using the simulated learners' data. The experimental results provide empirical evidence that the proposed work reduces the course failure rate and improves learners' success rate.},

abstract={Organizations continuously invest in the analysis of accumulated data by linking their exploitation to more effective decision making. Higher education and especially distance learning as a large data tank, follows the technological and financial needs to involve more flexible data analysis environments and better data-informed decision capabilities. Shrinking public subsidies drives higher education to form a more competitive learning environment. Satisfactory user experience and personalized services require a quantitative and qualitative analysis of students' daily action in learning environments. The increasing adoption of Learning Analytics (LA) and Educational Data Mining (EDM) push the development of novel approaches and advancements in education sector. At the same time, the rapid disclosure of hidden knowledge and the immediate presentation of results to optimize personalized decision making is a challenge for the competitiveness of distance learning. The objective of this study is the analysis of processes, technologies and resources used in an annual module at the Hellenic Open University to provide stakeholders with the visibility of interactions and hidden value in students' interactions. LA technologies are used on large set of data that has been collected by a Moodle platform and carefully analyzed. Students' logins, replies and quizzes are blended with the average grade of the main written exercises during the academic year. The contribution of this work is the useful observations from the students' educational on-line activities as predictive factors for their academic performance.},

abstract={In the last years, the design, implementation and delivery of web-based education systems, such as the Learning Management Systems, has grown exponentially, thanks to the fact that neither students nor teachers are bound to a specific location. Moreover, this form of computer-based education is virtually independent of any specific hardware platform and, as an important consequence, these systems are storing a large amount of educational data that could be used to improve the learning, the teaching and the administration processes. Extracting useful information represents a new challenge involving Machine Learning, Data Mining and Learning Analytics. Machine Learning is concerned with a large number of algorithms that improve their performance with experience, in many fields of research such as those learning contexts where students interact with learning systems leaving useful tracks. Educational Data Mining is the science of extracting useful information from the large data sets or databases containing students interactions during their learning, for example in a virtual environment. Finally, Learning Analytics is a set of steps for understanding and optimizing the whole learning process, together with the environment in which it occurs. It is composed by several steps, where the first is strictly related to Educational Data Mining for capturing data by some machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we discuss the intersections and correlations between these three areas of research, trying to discuss their relationships and steps to give a useful overview on the learning processes from different points of views. Different models are introduced and discussed.},

Data is collected, a predictive model is formulated, predictions are made, and the model is validated as additional data becomes available. The predictive models will help the instructor to understand how well or how poorly the students in his/her class will perform, and hence the instructor can choose proper pedagogical and instructional interventions to enhance student learning outcomes. The implementation is done in Hadoop framework with MapReduce and Revolutionary R Enterprise RRE.},

abstract={Educational data-mining is an evolving discipline that focuses on the improvement of self-learning and adaptive methods. It is used for finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures of educational data. In the arena of education, the heterogeneous data is involving and continuously growing in the paradigm of big-data. To extract meaningful information adaptively from big educational data, some specific data mining techniques are needed. This paper presents a clustering approach to partition students into different groups or clusters based on their learning behavior. Furthermore, the personalized e-learning system architecture is presented, which detects and responds to teaching contents according to the students’ learning capabilities. The primary objective includes the discovery of optimal settings, in which the learners can improve their learning capabilities. Moreover, the administration can find essential hidden patterns to bring the effective reforms in the existing system. The clustering methods K-Means, K-Medoids, Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, Agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster Tree and Clustering by Fast Search and Finding of Density Peaks via Heat Diffusion (CFSFDP-HD) are analyzed using educational data mining. It has been observed that more robust results can be achieved by the replacement of existing methods with CFSFDP-HD. The data mining techniques are equally effective in analyzing the big data to make education systems vigorous.},

abstract={Recently, e-learning resources become widespread in school education worldwide, as they are a prerequisite for an efficient learning process. These resources are scattered across many websites and their search takes too long. Despite their diversity, often it is difficult for teachers to find the proper resources. After analyzing the findings of an anonymous online survey of Bulgarian teachers on the use of ICT and e-learning resources, researchers identified the need for easy access to various e-resources for school education. The paper offers a concept for a centralized access portal where users to upload links to e-learning resources that are shortly described and classified according to several indicators. These include accessibility, type, subject, school grade, purpose and other meaningful parameters. Free registration for teachers and students will allow data to be aggregated by user groups, to carry out analyzes of the resources' usage, to draw trends, and to make conclusions for future policies.},

abstract={Educational data contains valuable information that can be harvested through learning analytics to provide new insights for a better education system. However, sharing or analysis of this data introduce privacy risks for the data subjects, mostly students. Existing work in the learning analytics literature identifies the need for privacy and pose interesting research directions, but fails to apply state of the art privacy protection methods with quantifiable and mathematically rigorous privacy guarantees. This work aims to employ and evaluate such methods on learning analytics by approaching the problem from two perspectives: (1) the data is anonymized and then shared with a learning analytics expert, and (2) the learning analytics expert is given a privacy-preserving interface that governs her access to the data. We develop proof-of-concept implementations of privacy preserving learning analytics tasks using both perspectives and run them on real and synthetic datasets. We also present an experimental study on the trade-off between individuals' privacy and the accuracy of the learning analytics tasks.},

Additionally, there is a need to explore what kinds of data are gathered from these platforms to exploit big data analytics opportunities. This paper evaluates three major online MOOC course providers namely Coursera, EdX, and Udacity. We first compare these platforms in terms of pedagogical support and implemented technologies. We then look at the literature and compare learning analytics support among these tools that are currently offered. We also suggest a set of analytics concepts that can aid instructors to mine student's interaction data and generate guidance for effective teaching.},

abstract={This paper attempts to understand the broader implications for integrating learning analytics in e-learning systems. This is also the commencement of a collaborative effort for developing research bases around learning analytics between the University of Mauritius and the University of KwaZuluNatal. The focus on e-assessments is deliberate: the tendancy in both our universities to appraise student learning as summative and quantitative does not reflect contemporary workplace and scholarly needs where learning processes are more valuable than outcomes. The necessity for epistemological rethinking and developing systems based on contextual requirements is important, whether it is related to curriculum development or workshop organisation or even conducting a class. After a survey of the literature on the potentials and hypes around learning analytics, we look towards the literature linking learning analytics, data mining and e-assessment for educators to interface more effectively and efficiently with the LMS platform. We conclude this concept-paper with a workshop outline which can help educational technologists organise practical, sustainable and meaningful hands-on sessions with educators.},

abstract={Analytics in education has been received much attention over the past decade. It is necessary to maintain high retention rate in any institutions of higher education, therefore several attempts on the application of analytics have been done for this problem. To detect students at high drop-out risk early and intervene them effectively, utilizing the educational big data can be useful. In this paper, an automatic detection method of academically at-risk students by using log data of learning management systems is considered. Some well-known machine learning methods are used to build a predictive model of student performance evaluated by GPA. By using actual data set, we investigate an availability of the proposed method and discuss its ability to early detection of off-task behavior. The experimental results indicated that some characteristics of behavior about learning which affect the learning outcomes can be detected with only the online log data. Furthermore, comparative importance of explanatory variables obtained by the approach would help to estimate which variable affects comparatively to the learning outcome and it can be used in institutional research.},

abstract={Learning analytics (LA) leverages learner-related data to generate reliable and factual information for the purpose of enhancing decision making in higher education, workplace and schools. Therefore, we have envisioned the need for a learning analytics system for a consortium of Nigerian universities that could serve as a tool for academic advising. The system should be able to offer advice at several layers of granularity such as individual, department, university and nation with the cardinal objective of facilitating student retention, student progression and cost saving. This paper reports the operational framework of the proposed LA system in the form of an n-tier layered architecture, which was designed after comprehensive requirements analysis. The design of the system encompasses mechanisms that address open issues confronting LA systems such as interoperability, security, scalability, amongst others. Besides addressing open problems, the study offers practical steps for the application of LA in an African clime, which so far, is not common in the literature. The proposed LA system for academic advising is presented as feasible and relevant for the advancement of higher education in Nigeria.},

abstract={Big data has changed the approach in designing an e-Learning. When students interact with e-Learning content, automatically generating data, we can collect and trace their learning tracks. The data is processed and analyzed, then used to understand the behavioral characteristics of the user or student to enable a personalized learning experience. In this study, learning analytics dashboard was used to improve learning interaction which impacts the learning successfulness. Tests were conducted on 67 students in the Educational Technology Department of the State University of Malang and distributed questionnaires and then analyzed using descriptive methods. The result is that most of the students who take online learning using the learning analytics dashboard find it helpful to carry out self-evaluations of their interaction hence they can manage their learning. The results of the study showed that most participants agreed that LAD could provide information to them regarding their interactions with learning content (M = 4.15, SD = 0.557), learning environment (M = 4.13, SD = 0.457), as well as the participants could conduct problem identification during their learning process (M = 3.88, SD = 0.477).},

abstract={Internet and organizational network security is still threatened by devastating malicious activities. Given the continuous escalation of such attacks in terms of their frequency, sophistication and stealthiness, it is of paramount importance to generate effective cyber threat intelligence that aim at inferring, attributing, characterizing and mitigating such misdemeanors. Nevertheless, such imperative tasks are partially impeded by the lack of approaches that can produce prompt and accurate actionable intelligence by investigating various network traffic sources. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a big data architecture that is rooted in real-time network traffic processing, distributed messaging and scalable data storage. The key innovation behind the proposed architecture is that it automates the analysis of heterogeneous network data, allowing the focus to remain on devising effective cyber threat intelligence analytics, rather than being hindered by data management, aggregation, reconciliation and formatting. Empirical evaluations investigating the application of machine learning analytics by exploiting the artifacts of the proposed architecture and by using 100 GB of real network traffic, indeed demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and addedvalue of the proposed architecture.},

abstract={One way to improve the education of our students is to promote the creation of mass collaborative projects. These projects, also seen as learning products, would also help to better scale our learning experiences (massive open online courses) and generate collective value from the hours and cognitive efforts invested doing academic work. However, the complexities to assess those projects are challenging. This requires developing new monitoring and feedback systems for this kind of projects. This paper presents an exploratory analysis for applying learning analytics methodologies based on social networks analysis, factorial analysis, k-means clustering, and “naïve” Bayes algorithms.},

abstract={Nowadays, many MOOC platforms have arisen to provide free knowledge. These platforms have a large catalog of courses for different specializations that progressively demand more specific learning resources and assessment methods to evaluate the progression of students. Current MOOC platforms are gradually giving support to these new requirements but with a limited assistance. This paper presents the state of art of the analytical system for three relevant MOOC platforms, one of the main pillars for analyzing the progression of courses. Other initiatives are also reviewed to show that current MOOC analytical systems are not ready to support custom MOOC-aware intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Thus, the design of a learning analytics system to assist these tools for MOOC platforms is presented.},

abstract={Teaching is complex activity which requires professors to employ the most effective and efficient teaching strategies to enable students to make progress. Main problem in teaching professors should consider different teaching approaches and learning techniques to suit every student. Today, in computer age, electronic learning (e-learning) is widely used in practice. Development of World Wide Web, especially Web2.0 has led to revolution in education. Student interaction with Learning management systems - LMS result in creating large data sets which are interesting for research. LMS systems also provide tools for following every individual student and statistical view for deeper analyzing result of student - system interaction. However, these tools do not include artificial intelligence algorithms as a support mechanism for decision. In this article we provide framework for student modeling trained on large sets of data using Hadoop and Mahout. This kind of system would provide insight into each individual student's activity. Based on that information, professors could adjust course materials according to student interest and knowledge.},

It is based on the principle of learning analytics with the support of big data, and is focused on elements of learning with formative and evaluative components. As part of the model, a acceptability matrix was elaborated with statistical functions that show signalized indications, alerting the tutor about the performance of each student typified as superior, high, basic, low and very low. When applying the matrix in pilot tests, it was conceived as an instrument of approach between tutor and student that allows a personalized follow-up and its result is reflected in an increase in academic performance.},

abstract={Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are Web-based platforms where educational contents, together with study support tools, are provided. Logs recording the interactions between students and VLEs are collected on a daily basis, thus automatic techniques are needed to manage and analyze such huge quantities of data. Students, teachers, managers, and in general all stakeholders involved in the VLEs' learning activities, can take advantage of the insights coming from educational data and useful information can be extracted by using machine learning techniques. Traditionally, educational data have been studied as stationary data by using conventional machine learning methods. However, educational data are non-stationary by nature and they can be better treated as data streams. In this paper, we show the results of a classification study where the random forest algorithm, applied both in batch and adaptive mode, is used to develop a model for predicting the failure/success of students' exams. Moreover, a feature importance analysis is carried out to detect the most discriminant attributes for the predictive task. Experiments were performed on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) showing the reliability of adaptive random forest in creating accurate classification models from evolving educational data.},
