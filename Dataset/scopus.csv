Differentiating between educational data mining and learning analytics: A bibliometric approach,"Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics are two relatively new research fields. Natural language techniques can be used to identify major research themes within each field. Similarities and differences between both domains are identified through the use of keyword analysis. Over 4,000 articles are analyzed and bibliometric techniques are used to select 60 articles that best represent major research themes within the intersection, as well as disjoint elements of both fields. Following keyword analysis, we conclude it is more accurate to describe what appears to be two domains (i.e. Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics) as one domain (i.e. Learning Analytics) with one prominent subset (i.e. Educational Data Mining).

"Contexts, critiques, and consequences: A discussion about educational data mining and learning analytics","The capture, aggregation, and analysis of student data is becoming ubiquitous at all levels of education—from primary to post-secondary—as institutions increase their adoption of information technologies to serve administrative and educational ends. In part, this has led to a growing interest among education scientists and administrators in strategically mining and analyzing troves of data in order to uncover student behaviors and intervene in student life. As is the case in other contexts where actors are pursuing Big Data's supposed benefits, educational data mining is fraught with moral, ethical, and political conflict. The panel is composed of four researchers who analyze and critique educational data mining practices and learning analytics initiatives in particular micro-and macro-contexts, including academic libraries and professional advising, urban schools, graduate-level online learning, and higher education generally. Each panelist also represents a unique conceptual background, pulling from work in information ethics and policy, critical data studies, documentation studies, and higher education policy to empirically analyze and critically evaluate tools, systems, practices, policies, and values. Through their individual but thematically intertwined perspectives, the panelists will present their research and lead audience members in discussion.

"Educational data sciences - Framing emergent practices for analytics of learning, organizations, and systems","In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework for organizing emerging analytic activities involving educational data that can fall under broad and often loosely defined categories, including Academic/Institutional Analytics, Learning Analytics/ Educational Data Mining, Learner Analytics/Personalization, and Systemic Instructional Improvement. While our approach is substantially informed by both higher education and K-12 settings, this framework is developed to apply across all educational contexts where digital data are used to inform learners and the management of learning. Although we can identify movements that are relatively independent of each other today, we believe they will in all cases expand from their current margins to encompass larger domains and increasingly overlap. The growth in these analytic activities leads to the need to find ways to synthesize understandings, find common language, and develop frames of reference to help these movements develop into a field.

Datawarehouse design for educational data mining,"Business intelligence (BI) builds upon a set of tools and applications that enable the analysis of vast amounts of information (Big Data). Educational institutions handle large volumes of Big Data every year. There is a strong need for the use of BI in these institutions to improve their processes and support decision making. The core technology in a BI project is a datawarehouse (DW). This paper describes the design considerations for the implementation of the DW in an educational scenario. The DW will be used in a knowledge discovery process to handle the information for the analysis of key performance indicators using educational data mining (EDM) techniques. The DW along with an enterprise architecture (EA) repository are the key technological assets of a knowledge management framework (KMF). This framework was designed to put order in the creation, capture, transfer and digitalization of knowledge. This guide and the framework are two of the outcomes of a research project in a private university. Furthermore, a case study suggests how to choose the best methodology in higher institutions.

"Kratos: A secure, authenticated and publicly verifiable system for educational data using the blockchain","Growing interest in educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) to leverage big data and to benefit education and the science of learning has made data ownership an important focus point for institutions and students. While EDM and LA can provide important information that help enhance the quality of teaching and learning, it has become critical to ensure data privacy and student agency over data. In this paper, we introduce Kratos: an immutable and publicly verifiable data management system that enables EDM and LA, while maintaining data privacy and empowering students with a user interface for data governance and participation in school processes. The system aims to achieve data interoperability, which facilitates EDM and LA as incentives to educational stakeholders (policy makers, educators, developers of education technologies, etc.), while prioritizing student agency over their data. Our system gives students and schools an immutable log along with comprehensive access to data that is otherwise scattered across systems and vendors. The underlying set of rules of the system are defined in a set of smart contracts, codified from existing non-virtual agreements [1] between schools and education technology (edutech) vendors. We propose the smart contracts to be deployed on a public blockchain (like Ethereum or Bitcoin), for notarizing and time-stamping various interactions which users of Kratos may have with data. Third parties requesting access to school data have a unique virtual token assigned to them on the blockchain which helps keep track of data modifications, access and use. © 2019 IEEE.",blockchain; data privacy; distributed data management systems; educational data mining; learning analytics,Big data; Blockchain; Data mining; Data privacy; Interoperability; Students; User interfaces; Data interoperability; Data management system; Distributed data managements; Education technology; Educational data mining; Educational data minings (EDM); learning analytics; Quality of teaching; Information management

Citizen science: The ring to rule them all?,"There are many uncertainties about the future of e-Learning, but one thing is certain: E-Learning will be more data-driven in the future. The automation of data capturing, analysis and presentation, together with economic constraints that require evidence-based proof of impact, compels this data focus. On the other hand, the importance of community involvement in learning analytics and educational data mining is an accepted fact. Citizen science, at the nexus of community engagement, and data science can bridge the divide between data-driven and community-driven approaches to policy and content development. The rationale for this paper is the investigation of citizen science as an approach to collecting data for learning analytics in the field of e-Learning. Capturing data for policy and content development for learning analytics through citizen science projects is novel in the e-Learning field. Like any other new area, citizen science needs to be mapped in terms of the existing parent fields of data science and education so that differences and potential overlaps can be made explicit. This is important when considering conceptual or functional definitions, research tools and methodologies. A preliminary review of the literature has not provided any conceptual positioning of citizen science in relation to the research topics of learning analytics, data science, big data and visualisation in the e-Learning environment. The intent of this paper is firstly to present an overview of citizen science and the related research topics in the academic and practitioner literature based on a systematic literature review. Secondly, we propose a model that represents the relationship between citizen science and other salient concepts and shows how citizen science projects can be positioned in the e-Learning environment. Finally, we suggest research opportunities involving citizen science projects in the field of e-Learning. © Academic Conferences Limited.

Machine learning and learning analytics: Integrating data with learning,"In the last years, the design, implementation and delivery of web-based education systems, such as the Learning Management Systems, has grown exponentially, thanks to the fact that neither students nor teachers are bound to a specific location. Moreover, this form of computer-based education is virtually independent of any specific hardware platform and, as an important consequence, these systems are storing a large amount of educational data that could be used to improve the learning, the teaching and the administration processes. Extracting useful information represents a new challenge involving Machine Learning, Data Mining and Learning Analytics. Machine Learning is concerned with a large number of algorithms that improve their performance with experience, in many fields of research such as those learning contexts where students interact with learning systems leaving useful tracks. Educational Data Mining is the science of extracting useful information from the large data sets or databases containing students interactions during their learning, for example in a virtual environment. Finally, Learning Analytics is a set of steps for understanding and optimizing the whole learning process, together with the environment in which it occurs. It is composed by several steps, where the first is strictly related to Educational Data Mining for capturing data by some machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we discuss the intersections and correlations between these three areas of research, trying to discuss their relationships and steps to give a useful overview on the learning processes from different points of views.

It involves machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to help the user for interpretation of student's learning habits, their academic performance and further improvement if required. In this paper we will discuss various techniques of data mining which are useful for predicting performance level of students.

Enhancing educational data mining techniques on online educational resources with a semi-supervised learning approach,"Both educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) focus on applying analytics and data mining techniques to extract useful information from large data sets. EDM is generally more interested in automated methods for discovery within the educational data while LA is relatively keen on applying human-led methods to understand the involved learning processes. Among the various fields of challenging studies in EDM, domain structure discovery is aimed to find the structure of knowledge in an educational domain, such as formulating the prerequisite requirements among various knowledge components through online educational resources. However, with the vast amount of knowledge components in specific subjects, the process of such formulation is very complicated and time-consuming no matter being done manually or semi-automatically. In this work, we propose a systematic framework of a semi-supervised learning approach in which a concept-based classifier is co-trained with an explicit semantic analysis (ESA) classifier to derive a common set of prerequisite rules based on a diverse set of online educational resources. To demonstrate its feasibility, a working prototype is built with some impressive results obtained in specific engineering subjects. More importantly, our proposal sheds light on many possible directions for future exploration. © 2015 IEEE.",educational data mining; explicit semantic analysis; knowledge components; semi-supervised learning,E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Semantics; Supervised learning; Concept based classifiers; Educational data mining; Educational data minings (EDM); Educational resource; Explicit semantic analysis; Knowledge components; Semi- supervised learning; Structure of knowledge; Data mining
Grade Prediction Method for University Course Selection Based on Decision Tree,"Educational Data Mining (EDM) refers to the use of suitable data mining methods and tools to discover knowledge from educational big data to help improve the quality of education, such as determining the priority learning needs of different student groups, increasing graduation rates, effectively evaluating the performance of the institution, and maximizing the use of campus resources and optimizing the update of subject courses. In this paper, we propose a grade prediction method to help university students choose courses reasonably. First of all, using big data analysis techniques, we can obtain the relationship between the performance of all students and course selection in recent years, and discover the influence of different course selection orders. Then, based on the current academic performance of a single student, the method can predict the impact of different elective courses for that student. Since students need to improve their future grade scores, predicting their performance will remind students to understand their performance and provide opportunities for their future performance. This method provides decision-making support for students' choices and enables them to choose courses reasonably to improve grades. This method also provides a foundation for university curriculum programs and reduces the number of dropouts. The data set for this study comes from the Student Information System of the Sokoine University of Agricultural (SUASIS), which includes data on student performance during academic activities. © 2020 ACM.",Classification; Course selection; Decision Tree; Educational Data Mining; Grade Prediction,Agricultural robots; Aviation; Big data; Data mining; Decision making; Decision trees; Forecasting; Safety engineering; Academic performance; Data analysis techniques; Decision making support; Educational data minings (EDM); Quality of education; Student performance; University curricula; University students; Students
A Hybrid Infrastructure of Enterprise Architecture and Business Intelligence Analytics for Knowledge Management in Education,"Advances in science and technology, the Internet of Things, and the proliferation of mobile apps are critical factors to the current increase in the amount, structure, and size of information that organizations have to store, process, and analyze. Traditional data storages present technical deficiencies when handling huge volumes of data and are not adequate for process modeling and business intelligence; to cope with these deficiencies, new methods and technologies have been developed under the umbrella of big data. However, there is still the need in higher education institutions (HEIs) of a technological tool that can be used for big data processing and knowledge management (KM). To overcome this issue, it is essential to develop an information infrastructure that allows the capturing of knowledge and facilitates experimentation by having cleaned and consistent data. Thus, this paper presents a hybrid information infrastructure for business intelligence and analytics (BIA) and KM based on an educational data warehouse (EDW) and an enterprise architecture (EA) repository that allows the digitization of knowledge and empowers the visualization and the analysis of dissimilar organizational components as people, processes, and technology. The proposed infrastructure was created based on research and will serve to run different experiments to analyze educational data and academic processes and for the creation of explicit knowledge using different algorithms and methods of educational data mining, learning analytics, online analytical processing (OLAP), and EA analytics. © 2013 IEEE.",Big data; business intelligence; data warehouse; educational data mining; knowledge management,Big data; Competitive intelligence; Data mining; Data visualization; Data warehouses; Knowledge management; Educational data mining; Educational data warehouse; Enterprise Architecture; Higher education institutions (HEIs); Information infrastructures; On-line analytical processing; Science and Technology; Technical deficiencies; Data handling
Big data analytics: Predicting academic course preference using hadoop inspired mapreduce,"With the emergence of new technologies, new academic trends introduced into Educational system which results in large data which is unregulated and it is also challenge for students to prefer to those academic courses which are helpful in their industrial training and increases their career prospects. Another challenge is to convert the unregulated data into structured and meaningful information there is need of Data Mining Tools. Hadoop Distributed File System is used to hold large amount of data. The Files are stored in a redundant fashion across multiple machines which ensure their endurance to failure and parallel applications. Knowledge extracted using Map Reduce will be helpful in decision making for students to determine courses chosen for industrial trainings. In this paper, we are deriving preferable courses for pursuing training for students based on course combinations.

Fueling Prediction of Player Decisions: Foundations of Feature Engineering for Optimized Behavior Modeling in Serious Games,"As a digital learning medium, serious games can be powerful, immersive educational vehicles and provide large data streams for understanding player behavior. Educational data mining and learning analytics can effectively leverage big data in this context to heighten insight into student trajectories and behavior profiles. In application of these methods, distilling event-stream data down to a set of salient features for analysis (i.e. feature engineering) is a vital element of robust modeling. This paper presents a process for systematic game-based feature engineering to optimize insight into player behavior: the IDEFA framework (Integrated Design of Event-stream Features for Analysis). IDEFA aligns game design and data collection for high-resolution feature engineering, honed through critical, iterative interplay with analysis. Building on recent research in game-based data mining, we empirically investigate IDEFA application in serious games. Results show that behavioral models which used a full feature set produced more meaningful results than those with no feature engineering, with greater insight into impactful learning interactions, and play trajectories characterizing groups of players. This discovery of emergent player behavior is fueled by the data framework, resultant base data stream, and rigorous feature creation process put forward in IDEFA—integrating iterative design, feature engineering, and analysis for optimal insight into serious play. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Behavior modeling; Educational data mining; Feature engineering; Feature selection; Game-based learning; Serious games,Data mining; Feature extraction; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Behavior model; Educational data mining; Feature engineerings; Game-based Learning; Integrated designs; Iterative design; Learning interactions; Recent researches; Serious games

Sources of Evidence-of-Learning: Learning and assessment in the era of big data,"This article sets out to explore a shift in the sources of evidence-of-learning in the era of networked computing. One of the key features of recent developments has been popularly characterized as ‘big data'. We begin by examining, in general terms, the frame of reference of contemporary debates on machine intelligence and the role of machines in supporting and extending human intelligence. We go on to explore three kinds of application of computers to the task of providing evidence-of-learning to students and teachers: (1) the mechanization of tests—for instance, computer adaptive testing, and automated essay grading; (2) data mining of unstructured data—for instance, the texts of student interaction with digital artifacts, textual interactions with each other, and body sensors; (3) the design and analysis of mechanisms for the collection and analysis of structured data embedded within the learning process—for instance, in learning management systems, intelligent tutors, and simulations. A consequence of each and all of these developments is the potential to record and analyze the ‘big data' that is generated. The article presents both an optimistic view of what may be possible as these technologies and pedagogies evolve, while offering cautionary warnings about associated dangers. © 2015, © 2015 The Author(s).

Process-oriented e-learning system for training healthcare professionals on big data usage,"Big data technology promises to transform the way in which medical care is delivered and help the healthcare industry to address problems related to variability in healthcare quality and escalating healthcare costs. However, integrating Big Data use in healthcare professionals' daily practice seems to be a challenging task as they are accustomed to making treatment decisions independently, using their own clinical judgement, rather than relying on protocols based on big data. Taking medical decisions based on Big Data - combined with physicians' valuable clinical knowledge and experience - can lead them to safer and more accurate diagnosis and focused treatments. In order to support this transformation in medical practice healthcare professionals (e.g. physicians, nurses, pharmacists) will need to be trained in the collection, integration and analysis of large data sets. To this end, this paper presents a process-oriented elearning system which aims at making healthcare professionals understand how to use big data tools and giving them the necessary skills to improve operations. The system uses workflow technology and Learning Analytics which has been specifically planned for learners' custom needs. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Measuring engagement to assess performance of students in distance learning,"Organizations continuously invest in the analysis of accumulated data by linking their exploitation to more effective decision making. Higher education and especially distance learning as a large data tank, follows the technological and financial needs to involve more flexible data analysis environments and better data-informed decision capabilities. Shrinking public subsidies drives higher education to form a more competitive learning environment. Satisfactory user experience and personalized services require a quantitative and qualitative analysis of students' daily action in learning environments. The increasing adoption of Learning Analytics (LA) and Educational Data Mining (EDM) push the development of novel approaches and advancements in education sector. At the same time, the rapid disclosure of hidden knowledge and the immediate presentation of results to optimize personalized decision making is a challenge for the competitiveness of distance learning. The objective of this study is the analysis of processes, technologies and resources used in an annual module at the Hellenic Open University to provide stakeholders with the visibility of interactions and hidden value in students' interactions. LA technologies are used on large set of data that has been collected by a Moodle platform and carefully analyzed. Students' logins, replies and quizzes are blended with the average grade of the main written exercises during the academic year.

The pursuit of patterns in educational data mining as a threat to student privacy,"Recent technological advances have led to tremendous capacities for collecting, storing and analyzing data being created at an ever-increasing speed from diverse sources. Academic institutions which offer open and distance learning programs, such as the Hellenic Open University, can benefit from big data relating to its students’ information and communication systems and the use of modern techniques and tools of big data analytics provided that the student’s right to privacy is not compromised. The balance between data mining and maintaining privacy can be reached through anonymisation methods but on the other hand this approach raises technical problems such as the loss of a certain amount of information found in the original data. Considering the learning process as a framework of interacting roles and factors, the discovery of patterns in that system can be really useful and beneficial firstly for the learn­ers and furthermore, the ability to publish and share these results would be very helpful for the whole academic institution. © 2018, Ubiquity Press.

A Proposed Learner Activity Taxonomy and a Framework for Analysing Learner Engagement versus Performance Using Big Educational Data,"The inclusion of information and communication technologies in Healthcare and Medical Education is a fact nowadays. Furthermore numerous virtual learning environments have been established in order to host both educational material and learners online activities. Online modules in a VLE can be designed in very different ways being part of different types of courses, while different models can be used to design the course based on what the creator aims to achieve. Thus, the types and the importance of the different elements of the online course may vary a lot. At the same time the need of a global approach to gather big educational data in order to provide valid meaning to the data through learning analytics and educational data mining is urgent. In order this to be achievable we propose a Learner Activity Taxonomy in which the different elements of the learners activity data can be categorised and a Learner Engagement Framework in which the importance of the different elements is vital in order for an analysis of the big educational data to provide a meaningful result. The initial application to practice of the Taxonomy and the Framework are presented based on data from 3 modules at 2 Universities, while the impact of them along with its limitations are discussed. © 2017 IEEE.",activity data; Big Data; learner engagement; Learning Analytics; online learning analysis; paradata,Big data; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Data mining; E-learning; Learning systems; Medical education; Taxonomies; Educational data mining; Educational materials; Information and Communication Technologies; learner engagement; Learning Analytics; Online learning; Paradata; Virtual learning environments; Education

Research limitations/implications: This research represents a reference to better understanding the influence and the role of big data in educational dynamic. In addition, it leads to improve existing literature about big data for learning. The limitations of the paper are given by its nature derived from a theoretical perspective, and the discussed ideas can be empirically validated by identifying how big data helps in addressing learning issues. Originality/value: Over the time, the process that leads to the acquisition of the knowledge uses and receives more technological tools and components; this approach has contributed to the development of information communication and the interactive learning context. Technology applications continue to expand the boundaries of education into an “anytime/anywhere” experience. This technology and its wide use in the learning system produce a vast amount of different kinds of data. These data are still rarely exploited by educational practitioners. Its successful exploitation conducts educational actors to achieve their full potential in a complex and uncertain environment. The general motivation for this research is assisting higher educational institutions to better understand the impact of the big data as a success factor to develop their learning process and achieve their educational strategy and goals. This study contributes to better understand how big data analytics solutions are turned into operational actions and will be particularly valuable to improve learning in educational institutions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Algorithm; Big data; E-learning; Higher education; Learning analytics; Learning process,
Big data and the measurement of public organizations’ performance and efficiency: The state-of-the-art,"The increasing availability of statistical data raises opportunities for ‘big’ data and learning analytics. Here, we review the academic literature and research relating to the use of big data analytics in the public sector, and its contribution to public organizations’ performance and efficiency.

Big data and learning analytics: Singular or plural?,"Recent critiques of both the uses of and discourse surrounding big data have raised important questions as to the extent to which big data and big data techniques should be embraced. However, while the context-dependence of data has been recognized, there remains a tendency among social theorists and other commentators to treat certain aspects of the big data phenomenon, including not only the data but also the methods and tools used to move from data as database to data that can be interpreted and assigned meaning, in a homogenizing way. In this paper, we seek to challenge this tendency, and to explore the ways in which explicit consideration of the plurality of big data might inform particular instances of its exploitation. We compare one currently popular big data-inspired innovation - learning analytics - with three other big data contexts - the physical sciences, business intelligence and public health. Through these comparisons, we highlight some dangers of learning analytics implemented without substantial theoretical, ethical and design effort. In so doing, we also highlight just how plural data, analytical approaches and intentions are, and suggest that each new big data context needs to be recognized in its own singularity. © First Monday.",,

Predicting students' academic performance: Levy search of cuckoo-based hybrid classification,"Educational Data Mining (EDM) exists as a novel trend in the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and Data Mining (DM) field that concerns in mining valuable patterns and finding out practical knowledge from the educational systems. However, evaluating the educational performance of students is challenging as their academic performance pivots on varied constraints. Hence, this paper intends to predict the educational performance of students based on socio-demographic information. To attain this, performance prediction architecture is introduced with two modules. One module is for handling the big data via MapReduce (MR) framework, whereas the second module is an intelligent module that predicts the performance of the students using intelligent data processing stages. Here, the hybridisation of classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Belief Network (DBN) is adopted to get better results. In DBN, Levy Search of Cuckoo (LC) algorithm is adopted for weight computation. Hence, the proposed prediction model SVM-LCDBN is proposed that makes deep connection with the hybrid classifier to attain more accurate output. Moreover, the adopted scheme is compared with conventional algorithms, and the results are attained. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Cuckoo search algorithm; Data mining; Deep belief network; Educational data mining; Levy flight; Map reduce framework; Support vector machine,Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Students; Support vector machines; Conventional algorithms; Deep belief network (DBN); Demographic information; Educational data minings (EDM); Educational performance; Intelligent data processing; Knowledge discovery in database; Performance prediction; Data mining
Using factorization machines for student modeling,"Predicting student performance (PSP), one of the task in Student Modeling, has been taken into account by educational data mining community recently. Previous works show that good results can be achieved by casting the PSP to rating prediction task in recommender systems, where students, tasks and performance scores are mapped to users, items and ratings respectively, and thus, matrix factorization -one of the most prominent approaches for rating prediction task - is an appropriate choice. In this work, we propose using Factorization Machines which combine the advantages of Support Vector Machines with factorization models for the problem of PSP. Experiments on two large data sets show that this approach can improve the prediction results over the standard matrix factorization.",,Educational data mining; Factorization machines; Factorization model; Large datasets; Matrix factorizations; Prediction tasks; Student Modeling; Student performance; Factorization; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Students

Utilization of RFID analytics in assessing student engagement,"The teaching and learning methods are increasingly adopting educational data mining approaches. This ever-changing landscape has allowed management to use educational data for strategic decision-making, offered students with relevant information to improve academic performance, and provided teachers with data on learners' behavior for effective teaching. To assess academically at-risk students, teachers need to gain valuable insights on student engagement, which includes class attendance, library and computer laboratory access, and use of other learning resources so that they can tailor the learning needs of students. Data analytics is used to examine student engagement inside and outside the classroom and predict learning trends. The popularity of Internet of Things and the convergence of RFID, Wireless Sensor Networks, Big Data, and Cloud Computing have enabled organizations to implement innovative information systems; however, their integrative potential has not been thoroughly explored. Having an RFID in combination with data analytics will provide various academic stakeholders valuable and critical information as regards students' learning behavior. Therefore, this paper reviews current trends of RFID in education and discusses opportunities of data analytics integration. Moreover, this paper also presents a conceptual framework of a basic RFID Analytic System that can be used in assessing student engagement. © 2017 IEEE.",data analytics; IoT; RFID; student engagement,Big data; Data mining; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Internet of things; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Risk assessment; Teaching; Wireless sensor networks; Academic performance; Computer laboratory; Conceptual frameworks; Data analytics; Educational data mining; Strategic decision making; Student engagement; Teaching and learning methods; Students
Mining educational game data: Uncovering complex mechanisms behind learning,"Data Mining refers to methods to find patterns, dependencies or other meaningful information from large data sets. Common methods for data mining are based on regression analysis, Bayesian models, clustering algorithms and neural networks. Data Mining has been successfully applied in science, business and logistics for years. However, educational Data Mining is relatively young discipline focusing on understanding students' use of interactive learning environments. According to original ideas of Data Mining, there are no hypotheses set in advance: the data will reveal the answers. The study focuses on the process of conceptual change (N = 818) while trying to reveal playing behavior that facilitates it and learning transfer. In the paper we briefly describe the conceptual change approach, data mining methods and our research framework for transfer. Finally, the results of the study are presented and discussed. The main result is a finding that difficulties in understanding different numbering systems are mediated by fraction numbers with odd numbered nominators. These results show the strengths of Educational Data Mining: we could point out difficulties and their backgrounds, which would not have been found without mining approach.",Data mining; Education; Games; User modeling,Bayesian networks; Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Computer aided instruction; Education; Learning systems; Numbering systems; Regression analysis; Complex mechanisms; Conceptual change; Data mining methods; Educational data mining; Games; Interactive learning environment; Research frameworks; User Modeling; Data mining
Monitoring students activities in CS courses,"The act of learning is becoming more and more sophisticated, thanks to several models and tools available today, like MOOCs, personalization, social networks, Web 2.0, gamification and others. This vast landscape leads to a huge amount of datasets thus the Big Data paradigm is also being adopted. Joined with Big Data is the emergency of extracting information about students' learning interactions and return them to teachers (learning analytics). According to this scenario, in this paper we introduce the e-learning platform currently used at University of Catania.

Who prophets from big data in education? New insights and new challenges,"Big Data can radically transform education by enabling personalized learning, deep student modeling, and true longitudinal studies that compare changes across classrooms, regions, and years. With these promises, however, come risks to individual privacy and educational validity, along with deep policy and ethical issues. Education is largely a public service targeted primarily at minors. Participation is compulsory in most advanced societies, and in many ways, it is seen as a fundamental right. Academic success is necessary for advancement, but students often have little individual say in the process. For these reasons, it poses unique policy challenges that do not arise in other domains. Big data requires deep and constant monitoring of students, classes, and instructors. Who consents to such monitoring, and how will student or instructor privacy be preserved? Data also has immense commercial value. Who owns it? And who is permitted to profit from its use? In this article, I will discuss some of these unique issues, and I will outline some potential approaches that may be taken to address them. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Data-driven assessment; educational data mining; ethics; personalized learning; policy; privacy,
A Study on the Application of Big Data to the Korean College Education System,"Big data are referred to bulk data which cannot be collected, saved, and analyzed with the traditional data analysis tools. The field of learning analysis, which has consistently appeared on the Horizon Report from New Media Consortium for the recent years, is receiving fresh attention with the proliferation of big data. The purpose of this study is to examine the environment for the learning analytics, a branch field of big data, to be applied to the Korean education curricular and its possibility and find out how to improve them. First, as an application of a new technology involves side effects in most cases, it is desirable that potential problems be considered from the beginning and negative effects be minimized. Second, the learning analytics begins with securing sufficient data, and a data exchange system should be established for setting up the data ecology. Third, as big data are applied to public data and the corporate business areas and frequently mentioned in the media, the expectation for their potential growth is reaching its peak. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Big-Data; Horizon Report; Learning analytics; Predictive Analytics,Electronic data interchange; College education; Data analysis tool; Data exchange system; Horizon Report; Learning analytics; Potential growth; Potential problems; Predictive analytics; Big data
Assessing learners’ satisfaction in collaborative online courses through a big data approach,"Monitoring learners' satisfaction (LS) is a vital action for collecting precious information and design valuable online collaborative learning (CL) experiences. Today's CL platforms allow students for performing many online activities, thus generating a huge mass of data that can be processed to provide insights about the level of satisfaction on contents, services, community interactions, and effort. Big Data is a suitable paradigm for real-time processing of large data sets concerning the LS, in the final aim to provide valuable information that may improve the CL experience. Besides, the adoption of Big Data offers the opportunity to implement a non-intrusive and in-process evaluation strategy of online courses that complements the traditional and time-consuming ways to collect feedback (e.g. questionnaires or surveys). Although the application of Big Data in the CL domain is a recent explored research area with limited applications, it may have an important role in the future of online education. By adopting the design science research methodology, this article describes a novel method and approach to analyse individual students' contributions in online learning activities and assess the level of their satisfaction towards the course. A software artefact is also presented, which leverages Learning Analytics in a Big Data context, with the goal to provide in real-time valuable insights that people and systems can use to intervene properly in the program. The contribution of this paper can be of value for both researchers and practitioners: the former can be interested in the approach and method used for LS assessment; the latter can find of interest the system implemented and how it has been tested in a real online course. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Big data; Clustering; Collaborative learning; Learning analytics; Learning satisfaction; Sentiment analysis,Big data; Curricula; Data handling; Real time systems; Sentiment analysis; Surveys; Clustering; Collaborative learning; Design-science researches; Learning analytics; Learning satisfactions; Level of satisfaction; Online collaborative learning; Online learning activities; E-learning; adoption; article; artifact; big data; collaborative learning; education; human; human experiment; physician; questionnaire; satisfaction; scientist; software; student

Predicting Achievement of Students in Smart Campus,"Isolate data among different campus information systems and not much effective information among the big data generated by these systems cause that it is a challenge for predicting achievement of students. This paper designs a student achievement predicting framework, which includes data processing and student achievement predicting. In the data processing, data extraction, data cleaning, and feature extraction are designed. Using these data in data warehouse, we propose a layer-supervised multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based method to predict the achievement of students. Supervisions are fed to each corresponding hidden layer of MLP to improve the performance of student achievement prediction. Compared with SVM, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and MLP, our method gets a better performance. © 2013 IEEE.",Educational data mining; multi-layer perceptron neural network; predict achievement of students; smart campus,Big data; Cleaning; Data handling; Data processing; Data warehouses; Database systems; Extraction; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Network layers; Standards; Students; Campus information systems; Educational data mining; Logistic regressions; Multi layer perceptron; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Predict Achievement ofstudents; Smart Campus; Student achievement; Data mining
Educational justice and big data,"This article examines the effects of incorporating information and communication technologies in schools in terms of distributive justice. To do so, four issues that are central to educational justice are discussed: scarcity of resources, the positional nature of education, peer effects, and biases in educational decision-making. The discussion exposes a complicated picture of possible benefits and challenges associated with incorporating data-rich technologies in education. While technology may potentially promote educational justice – by widening access to quality teaching, decreasing biases, and facilitating mixed ability classes – it also creates concerns, related to ensuring equal distribution of technology, preventing biases in educational data mining, and fostering the kind of social relations between students necessary for democratic equality. The article concludes that whether or not information and communication technologies will have a positive impact on educational justice depends, largely, on the way it is developed, designed, and implemented in schools. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Bias; big data; discrimination; distributive justice; educational equality; peer effects; positional goods,
Factorization models for forecasting student performance,"Predicting student performance (PSP) is one of the educational data mining task, where we would like to know how much knowledge the students have gained and whether they can perform the tasks (or exercises) correctly. Since the student's knowledge improves and cumulates over time, the sequential (temporal) effect is an important information for PSP. Previous works have shown that PSP can be casted as rating prediction task in recommender systems, and therefore, factorization techniques can be applied for this task. To take into account the sequential effect, this work proposes a novel approach which uses tensor factorization for forecasting student performance. With this approach, we can personalize the prediction for each student given the task, thus, it can also be used for recommending the tasks to the students. Experimental results on two large data sets show that incorporating forecasting techniques into the factorization process is a promising approach.",,Educational data mining; Factorization model; Factorization techniques; Forecasting techniques; Know-how; Large datasets; Prediction tasks; Sequential effects; Student performance; Tensor factorization; Data mining; Factorization; Forecasting; Students
The evolution of big data and learning analytics in american higher education,"Data-driven decision making, popularized in the 1980s and 1990s, is evolving into a vastly more sophisticated concept known as big data that relies on software approaches generally referred to as analytics.

Continuous clustering in big data learning analytics,"Learners' attainment of academic knowledge in postsecondary institutions is predominantly expressed by summative or formative assessment approaches. Recent advances in educational technology has hinted at a means to measure learning efficiency, in terms of personalization of learner competency and capacity in terms of adaptability of observed practices, using raw data observed from study experiences of learners as individuals and as contributors in social networks. While accurate computational models that embody learning efficiency remain a distant and elusive goal, big data learning analytics approaches this goal by recognizing competency growth of learners, at various levels of granularity, using a combination of continuous, formative and summative assessments. This study discusses a method to continuously capture data from students' learning interactions. Then, it analyzes and clusters the data based on their individual performances in terms of accuracy, efficiency and quality by employing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.",Big Data; Hadoop; K-Means Clustering; Learning Analytics; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based Clustering,Efficiency; Engineering education; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Based clustering; Big datum; Hadoop; K-means clustering; Learning Analytics; Learning systems

Big data academic and learning analytics: Connecting the dots for academic excellence in higher education,"Purpose: Although big data analytics (BDA) have great benefits for higher education institutions (HEIs), due to lack of sufficient evidence on how BDA investment can pay off, it is tough for HEIs practitioners to realize value from such adoption. The purpose of this paper is to propose a big data academic and learning analytics enabled business value model to explain BDA potential benefits and business value which can be obtained by developing such analytics capabilities in HEIs. Design/methodology/approach: The study examined 47 case descriptions from 26 HEIs to investigate the causal association between the BDA current and potential benefits and business value creation path for big data academic and learning analytics success in HEIs. Findings: The pressure of compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements and competition had pushed HEIs hard to adopt BDA tools. However, the study found out that application of risk and security and predictive analytics to higher education fields is still in its infancy. Using this theoretical model, the results provide new insights to higher education administrators on ways to create BDA capabilities for HEIs transformation and suggest an empirical foundation that can lead to more thorough analysis of BDA implementation. Originality/value: A distinctive theoretical contribution of this study is its conceptualization of understanding business value from BDA in the typical setting of higher education. The study provides HEIs with an all-inclusive understanding of BDA and gives insights on how it helps to transform HEIs. The new perspectives associated with the big data academic and learning analytics enabled business value model will contribute to future research in this area. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Big data analytics; Business value,

Design and application of intervention model based on learning analytics under blended learning environment,"The arrival of big data and AI era promote educational reforms, which make personalized learning become normalization. Teaching intervention is an indispensable bridge between big data and students' personalized learning. This study proposes an intervention model based on learning analytics from four iteration modules: data collection, data processing, intervention implementation and effect evaluation, and applies it to blended learning environment. Through one-group pretest-posttest experiment design, the effect of the intervention model were measured by learning engagement and learning achievement. The results show that the intervention model can effectively improve students' behavioral engagement and cognitive engagement as well as learning achievement, especially for risky students. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Blended learning; Intervention model; Learning analytics; Learning engagement,Big data; Data handling; Education computing; Students; Blended learning; Blended learning environments; Design and application; Intervention models; Learning analytics; Learning engagement; Personalized learning; Teaching intervention; Computer aided instruction
"Profuturo, a social initiative to improve education with e-learning analytical tools","One of the main factors that governments and enterprises have to bridge the digital gap in society is Education. Profuturo is a foundation that develops a proposal on digital education in order to reduce that gap in vulnerable areas working with e-learning programs. These e-learning activities bring them a large data set that can be analyzed with learning analytics tools, such as big data or artificial intelligence technology. The use of these technologies has the aim to improve the learning process in those vulnerable areas and to act in a personal way such as the students have been demanded. This short paper shows how the data analysis obtained from mathematics and linguistic data can be used in order to identify talented students in those areas. © Copyright 2019 IADIS Press All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; E-Learning; Online Education; Profuturo Foundation,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Learning systems; Students; Analytical tool; Analytics tools; Artificial intelligence technologies; Large datasets; Learning process; Linguistic data; On-line education; Vulnerable area; E-learning
A Systematic analysis of Data-intensive MOOCs and their key Challenges,"Big Data blends modern technologies with numerous data management techniques to handle a wide variety of concerns that occur when operating with data of huge volume, variety and velocity. Big data deals with complex semi-structured and unstructured data from several sources and formats which include Social Media content in free form, data from E-commerce sites, Weather forecasting statistics, Clinical Diagnosis, Share Market Transactions and Smart Computing Environments. In the same way, big data offers substantial prospects in the discipline of Education, E-Learning and Learning Analytics. Application of big data analytics in E-Learning helps to assess the quality of Teaching, Development of Curriculum, predict learning outcomes, Career Development and Readiness, Attrition Risks and Feedback Analysis. The Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have produced a major influence on E-Learning with the availability of Live and pre-recorded Lectures, Easy-to-learn Tutorials, Novel Assessment Methodologies, Quick feedback and results.

Academic Performance Prediction Using Chance Discovery from Online Discussion Forums,"In this paper, we present our preliminary results of identifying serendipitous findings from discussion forums of students by using a text-mining analytical tool to predict their academic performances. The analytical results were visualized by constructing KeyGraphs so that teachers can assess the effectiveness of teaching and innovation of learning respectively through the visualization of hidden patterns in the online learning environment. Our results show that the serendipitous findings have shown a traceable pattern, which is statistically significant to predict the academic performance of students. The research findings can lead to adaptive pedagogical designs for teaching and learning by finding hidden patterns and linkages among the students' serendipitous learning. The identified results are expected to support both teachers and students on how to improve teaching and learning with feedbacks from this new tool. Ultimately, this creates a new approach for transformative learning and teaching in education by using the advanced mining technology to assess the students' knowledge discovery process. © 2016 IEEE.",Big Data; Chance Discovery; Educational data mining; KeyGraph; Learning Analytics; Serendipitous Learning; Topic Detection,Application programs; Big data; Computer aided instruction; Computer software; Education; Forecasting; Online systems; Students; Teaching; Chance discovery; Educational data mining; Keygraph; Learning Analytics; Serendipitous Learning; Topic detection; Data mining
Personalized learning environment in higher education through big data and blended learning analytics,"Blended learning is seen as one of the effective ways of engaging learners in higher educational institutions. The e-learning platforms have further facilitated in adapting to learner centric approach of teaching learning. Analytics have played major role in revolutionizing various sectors including education. Blended learning analytics provides inferences which when utilized effectively by the educator and learner would enhance the teaching-learning experience. Huge amount of varied data is generated when learner and educator interact with e-learning platforms, this when coupled with other demographic information can be used to personalize the learning experience. This necessitates the need of a framework which can capture and use the digital data. © BEIESP.",Big Data; Blended Learning Analytics; Higher education; Personalized learning,
The Antecedent of Student Academic Achievement Prediction,"The research goal was set to determine to what extent the influences of learning analytics and academic analytics, the antecedent factors in predicting student academic achievement through the use of big data were. There has been no discussion on progress, success, retention, or decline of this achievement. Therefore, this research has significance for the improvement of higher education institutions. The research was in the form of online surveys involving 203 respondents, i.e., leaders, structural staff, and academic advisors from each of these institutions in Pontianak. Tests of eight hypotheses were conducted through SEM-PLS Method, and two of them had no direct influences. The results show that the two antecedent factors, directly and indirectly, have different influences and significance values on student academic achievement prediction despite the critical roles of big data. In addition, results obtained through the application of learning analytics and academic analytics in relation to big data of higher education institutions, especially for the need to predict student academic achievement, are infrequently similar. © 2020 IEEE.",Academic Analytics; Big Data; Learning Analytics; Prediction; Student Academic Achievement,Big data; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Surveys; Academic achievements; Higher education institutions; Online surveys; Research goals; Students
Profiling and Supporting Adaptive Micro Learning on Open Education Resources,"It is found that learners prefer to use micro learning mode to conduct learning activities through open educational resources (OERs). However, adaptive micro learning is scarcely supported by current OER platforms. In this paper we focus on profiling an effective micro learning process which is central to establish the raw materials and set up rules for the final adaptive process. This work consists of two parts. First, we conducted an educational data mining and learning analysis study to discover the patterns and rules in micro learning through OER. Then based on its findings, we profiled features of both learners and OERs to reveal the full learning story in order to support the decision making process. Incorporating educational data mining and learning analysis, an cloud-based architecture for Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS) was designed to integrate all necessary procedures together as a complete service for delivering micro OERs. The MLaaS also provides a platform for resource sharing and exchanging in peer-to-peer learning environment. Working principle of a key step, namely the computational decision-making of micro OER adaptation, was also introduced. © 2016 IEEE.",Learner Profile; Linked Data; Micro Learning; Open Education Resource; Pattern and Rule Discovery,Big data; Computer aided instruction; Data mining; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Education; Learner profiles; Linked datum; Micro-learning; Open Education Resources; Rule discovery; Learning systems
Certain investigations on big data approaches in education and learning analytics,"The applications of computerized tools for learning management systems in education have been increasing in the last few years. Online contents by means of mobile phones, primarily smart phones enable the students to keep the learning processes around the clock. The enormous amount of data captured from student’s online activities is wasted as traditional learning analytics are not capable of processing them. So in this paper it is proposed to use Big Data technologies and tools into education for capturing learning process of students, strategic operational decisions at institutions. The computing platform and teaching methods to accommodate emerging technologies for related courses are also investigated in this paper. In addition, visualization-based data discovery tools are focused on the front end of big data on helping institutions explore the data more easily and understand it more fully. © 2016, Institute of Integrative Omics and Applied Biotechnology.

Machine learning based on big data extraction of massive educational knowledge,"A learning environment generates massive knowledge by means of the services provided in MOOCs. Such knowledge is produced via learning actor interactions. This result is a motivation for researchers to put forward solutions for big data usage, depending on learning analytics techniques as well as the big data techniques relating to the educational field. In this context, the present article unfolds a uniform model to facilitate the exploitation of the experiences produced by the interactions of the pedagogical actors. The aim of proposing the said model is to make a unified analysis of the massive data generated by learning actors. This model suggests making an initial pre-processing of the massive data produced in an e-learning system, and it's subsequently intends to produce machine learning, defined by rules of measures of actors knowledge relevance. All the processing stages of this model will be introduced in an algorithm that results in the production of learning actor knowledge tree.",Big data analysis; Knowledge management; Learning analytics; Machine learning; Operational data,Big data; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Machine learning; Metadata; Trees (mathematics); Data extraction; Educational knowledge; Learning actors; Learning analytics; Learning environments; Operational data; Processing stage; Unified analysis; Computer aided instruction
LAL workshop: Learning analytics for learners,"With the arrival of 'big data' in education, the potential was recognised for learning analytics to track students' learning, to reveal patterns in their learning, or to identify at-risk students, in addition to guiding reform and supporting educators in improving teaching and learning processes [1]. Learning Analytics dashboards have been used at all levels, including institutional, regional and national level [2]. In classroom use, while learning visualisations are often based on counts of activity data or interaction patterns, there is increasing recognition that learning analytics relate to learning, and should therefore provide pedagogically useful information [3]. While increasing numbers of technology-enhanced learning applications are embracing the potential of learning analytics at the classroom level, often these are aimed at teachers. However, learners can also benefit from learning analytics data (e.g. [4][5]). © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Dashboards; Learning analytics for learners; Learning data for learners; Open learner models; Visual learning analytics,Big data; Education; Education computing; Teaching; Dashboards; Learning analytics for learners; Learning data; Open learner models; Visual learning; Learning systems
A Survey on Educational Data Mining [2014-2019],"Nowadays Data Mining is used in many application areas enabling large data streams and algorithms for analysis and extraction of powerful data. On their side, the Computer Environments for Human Learning (EIAH) offer TEL devices (Technology-enhanced learning) such as simulators, serious games, MOOCs (massive online open courses), or educational platforms. These devices provide data that are traces of the activities of students or teachers. The data produced are cognitive information of very fine levels (student knowledge, skills, and errors) and require specific analysis and processing tools, we talk here about educational data mining methods, Educational data processing (EDM) is rising as a notion of research and analysis with a set of machine and psychological ways and research approaches for understanding however students learn. EDM uses machine approaches to research instructional knowledge so as to review instructional queries. For this knowledge exploration, several tools were used like personal learning environments, recommender systems, Context learning, and Course management systems. These tools offer numerous edges for instructional data processing. In this survey, we have a tendency to focus and supply numerous tools of analysis trends exploitation EDM Tools to explore data and knowledge, and explaining the process of EDM application, the goal is not only to transform the data into knowledge but also to filter the extracted knowledge to know how to modify the educational environment to improve learners' learning.

Improving education through data mining,"Data mining techniques have proved their effectiveness in improving the quality of education. This paper provides a concise and brief investigation of ways in which data mining is used by researchers in education. We now live in the era of big data, and not all this data is useful to us. Researchers are concerned with how to get insight and useful information from raw data. Today's education institutions are facing the biggest challenges of all time. How can they make improvements in education to keep up with the 21st century new demands? How can they improve the process of decision making and students' performance? These objectives have become more challenging following changes in education institutions. One way to improve decision making is through the use of efficient information systems and modern technology. New knowledge related to the decision-making process is obtained from historical data or data from operations of the education institutions through data mining. The knowledge gained in this process is used to improve decision making, and therefore the quality of education. © 2014 WIT Press.",Big data; Data mining; Decision making; Educational data mining; Learning institutions,Big data; Communication systems; Data mining; Decision making; Information technology; Societies and institutions; Decision making process; Education institutions; Educational data mining; Historical data; Modern technologies; Quality of education; Education
Big data and the liberal conception of education,"This article develops a perspective on big data in education, drawing on a broadly liberal conception of education’s primary purpose. We focus especially on the rise of so-called learning analytics and the associated rise of digitization, which we evaluate according to the liberal view that education should seek to cultivate individuality and proceed partly by way of experimentation and with an emphasis on civic education. Our argument is not that the use of big data is wholly out of place in education. Indeed, it might have significant value in pursuit of certain educational aims. Nevertheless, the liberal conception shows how education is distinct from other domains in which big data are being applied, in ways that suggest that considerable caution must be exercised when they are used in educational contexts. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Big data; civic education; individuality; liberalism,
A systematic review on big data analytics frameworks for higher education - Tools and algorithms,"The development of Big Data applications in education has drawn much attention in the last few years due to the enormous benefits it brings to improving teaching and learning. The integration of these Big Data applications in education generates massive data that put new demands to available processing technologies of data and extraction of useful information. Primarily, several higher educational institutions depend on the knowledge mined from these vast volumes of data to optimise the teaching and learning environment. However, Big Data in the higher education context has relied on traditional data techniques and platforms that are less efficient. This paper, therefore, conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that examines Big Data framework technologies in higher education outlining gaps that need a solution in Big Educational Data Analytics. We achieved this by summarising the current knowledge on the topic and recommend areas where educational institutions could focus on exploring the potential of Big Data Analytics. To this end, we reviewed 55 related articles out of 1543 selected from Six (6) accessible Computer Science databases between the period of 2007 and 2018, focusing on the development of the Big Data framework and its applicability in education for academic purposes. Our results show that very few researchers have tried to address the integrative use of Big Data framework and learning analytics in higher education. The review further suggests that there is an emerging best practice in applying Big Data Analytics to improve teaching and learning. However, this information does not appear to have been thoroughly examined in higher education. Hence, there is the need for a complete investigation to come up with comprehensive Big Data frameworks that build effective learning systems for instructors, learners, course designers and educational administrators. © 2019 ACM.",Big Data; Big Educational Data; Data Mining; Higher Education; Learning Analytics; MS,Advanced Analytics; Big data; Computer aided instruction; Data Analytics; Data handling; Education computing; Electronic commerce; Information management; Learning systems; Teaching; Big Educational Data; Educational administrators; Educational institutions; Higher education; Learning Analytics; Processing technologies; Systematic literature review (SLR); Teaching and learning environments; Data mining
STEMscopes: Contextualizing learning analytics in a K-12 science curriculum,"In this paper, we discuss a scalable approach for integrating learning analytics into an online K-12 science curriculum. A description of the curriculum and the underlying pedagogical framework is followed by a discussion of the challenges to be tackled as part of this integration. We also include examples of data visualization based on real student and teacher data. With more than one million students and fifty thousand teachers using the curriculum, a massive and rich dataset is continuously updated. This repository depicts teacher and students usage of an inquiry-based science program, and offers exciting opportunities to leverage research to improve both teaching and learning. The growing dataset, with more than a hundred million items of activity in six months, also poses technical challenges such as data storage, complex aggregation and analysis with broader implications for pedagogy, big data, and learning. © 2013 ACM.",big data; learning analytics; online curriculum; STEM education,Big datum; Contextualizing learning; Inquiry-based science; learning analytics; Online curriculum; STEM education; Teaching and learning; Technical challenges; Data visualization; Students; Teaching; Curricula
Learning analytics as a core component for Higher education disruption: Governance stakeholder,"Higher education institutions are at this stage, on the one hand, faced with challenges never seen before and, on the other hand, their action is moving very rapidly into digital learning spaces. These challenges are increasingly complex because of the global competition for resources, students and teachers. In addition, the amount of data produced inside and outside higher education institutions has grown exponentially, so more and more institutions are exploring the potential of Big Data to meet these challenges. In this context, higher education institutions and key stakeholders (students, teachers, and governance) can derive multiple benefits from learning analytics using different data analysis strategies to produce summative, real-time and predictive information and recommendations. However, it may be questioned whether institutions, academic administrative staff as well as including those with responsibility for governance, are prepared for learning analytics? As a response to the question raised in this paper is presented an extension of a disruptive conceptual approach to higher education, using information gathered by IoT and based on Big Data & Cloud Computing and Learning Analytics analysis tools, with the main focus on the stakeholder governance. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Disruption; Governance; Higher education institutions; Learning analytics,Ecosystems; Predictive analytics; Students; Teaching; Administrative staff; Analysis strategies; Conceptual approaches; Disruption; Governance; Higher education institutions; Learning analytics; Predictive information; Big data

"Learning Analytics: at the Nexus of Big Data, Digital Innovation, and Social Justice in Education","We are still designing educational experiences for the average student, and have room to improve. Learning analytics provides a way forward. This commentary describes how learning analytics-based applications are well positioned to meaningfully personalize the learning experience in diverse ways. In so doing, learning analytics has the potential to contribute to more equitable and socially just educational outcomes for students who might otherwise be seen through the lens of the average student. Utilizing big data, good design, and the input of the stakeholders, learning analytics techniques aim to develop applications for the sole purpose of reducing the classroom size to 1. Over time, these digital innovations will enable us to do away with a model of education that teaches toward the non-existent average student, replacing it with one that is more socially just—one that addresses the individual needs of every student. © 2017, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.",Applications; Digital innovation; Educational technology; Learning analytics; Personalized learning; Social justice,
Information systems innovation adoption in higher education: Big data and analytics,"Much as the term analytics is not new in the research field. However, analytics and big data are still not fully understood, nor yet been thoroughly and empirically researched by institutions of higher education (HE), more so, in the South African context. Many organizations and businesses are welcoming and adopting such an information system innovation. However, there has been a limited interest in the adoption big data and analytics in institutions of HE. The lack of interest in big data and analytics from HE institutions has caused institutions to function with substantial delays in analysing readily evident data. Furthermore, the lack of adequate theoretical frameworks for IS adoption in HE institutions has steered the many failures to produce meaningful, accessible and timely information for decision making. Therefore this calls for the development of a conceptualized framework for the adoption of big data and analytics in institutions of HE. © 2016 IEEE.",academic analytics; analytic; Big data; IS adoption; learning analytics; predictive analytics,Decision making; Education; Information systems; Predictive analytics; Societies and institutions; academic analytics; analytic; Information systems innovation; Institutions of higher educations; IS adoption; learning analytics; Substantial delays; Theoretical framework; Big data
A pedagogic method helps to create an actionable policy from big data through a PDCA cycle,"Big data and learning analytics for higher education is a rapidly growing field with disruptive potential. However, there has been little research reported on a pedagogic method that helps to create an actionable policy from big data. In recent years, there is a meaningful debate that big data alone cannot improve teaching, and more research is needed from a pedagogic point of view. We, therefore, developed a pedagogic method called BDAL (big data for active learning) that helps to create an actionable policy through a PDCA (plan-docheck-act) cycle. It facilitates students to examine their goals and motivations, to improve learning styles, and to be an active learner. An experiment was conducted on 556 undergraduate students for a control group and an experimental group. With the help of BDAL, we were able to gain an actionable policy to improve education further both in and out of classrooms.

Governing by data: Some considerations on the role of learning analytics in education,"E-governance is growing in interest as a technique of decision making in the public domain. The technological revolution is, in fact, enabling governments to use a great variety of digital tools and data to manage more effectively all phases of the policy cycle process. Although still in its infancy, the use of big data is becoming a core element of the emergence of e-governance as a form of evidence-based policy making. We are assisting to the emergence of a form of governing by data, where governments will take more and more sensitive decisions through data mining systems. Education is one of the policy fields where the use of big data such as learning analytics is becoming crucial for funds allocation, institutional accountability, and programs review.

Implementing machine learning on a big data engine for e-learning,"Due to high volume, velocity, and variety (referred to as ""3V"") of data production, the term ""big data"" has recently emerged. Because of such fast data growth, Data centers of educational institutions are seemingly exploding as well. Therefore, big data is making its way to the field of E-learning. Nowadays large educational institutions feel the urgent need to analyze this flood of data to provide students with higher quality of services. Despite the fact that there is huge volume and variety of data with high velocity of production, the existing traditional methods are unable to analyze such data. In other words, there is little done on implementing learning analytics on big data engines. The author created a scalable machine learning system on a cluster of three machines suitable for large dataset operations using big data engine and implemented an early warning process with machine learning techniques. The dataset was obtained from online and semionline courses from The University of Tehran. Many features like access time, history of access and history of actions of students were extracted and used for the classification task. A parallel distributed classification process was run to predict students' success and failures. It offers a fast, scalable and in-memory process with apache Spark. Eventually, the research compares the efficiency of proposed method with current and common methods'. The results reveal that our model had a high classification accuracy and the larger the dataset, the more efficient our process will be. It also discusses a new term ""learning analytic"" and ""big data"" that are completely new and worth reading.

Using big data to sharpen design-based inference in A/B tests,"Randomized A/B tests in educational software are not run in a vacuum: often, reams of historical data are available alongside the data from a randomized trial. This paper proposes a method to use this historical data–often high-dimensional and longitudinal–to improve causal estimates from A/B tests. The method proceeds in two steps: first, fit a machine learning model to the historical data predicting students’ outcomes as a function of their covariates. Then, use that model to predict the outcomes of the randomized students in the A/B test. Finally, use design-based methods to estimate the treatment effect in the A/B test, using prediction errors in place of outcomes. This method retains all of the advantages of design-based inference, while, under certain conditions, yielding more precise estimators. This paper will give a theoretical condition under which the method improves statistical precision, and demonstrates it using a deep learning algorithm to help estimate effects in a set of experiments run inside ASSISTments. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Tendency to use big data in education based on its opportunities according to andalusian education students,"Big Data is configured as a technological element and of increasing educational interest. The need to advance the quality of academic inclusion has led to an unprecedented expansion of educational processes and features. Thus, collecting massive data on educational information is part of teachers' daily lives and educational institutions themselves. There is an intense debate about the potential of Big Data in the educational context, especially through learning analytics that favor the appropriate, responsible, and inclusive use of the data collected. The main aim of this article is to analyze user profiles and the tendency to use Big Data and see what factors influence its applicability. This study employs an incidental sample of 265 students of Educational Sciences from Andalusian Universities, (Spain), using an ad-hoc survey. A cluster analysis was conducted together with ordinal regression analysis and decision tree. The results allow us to confirm the existence of two different student profiles, in terms of their perceptions and appraisal of Big Data and its implications in education. Consequently, a higher score is found for that profile that contemplates and positively conceives Big Data in terms of learning opportunities and improvement of educational quality. The research demonstrates the need to promote Big Data training within the context of university, aiding the acquisition of digital and transversal skills. © 2020 by the authors.",Big data; Education; Profiles; Training,
Inferring Learning from Big Data: The Importance of a Transdisciplinary and Multidimensional Approach,"The use of big data in higher education has evolved rapidly with a focus on the practical application of new tools and methods for supporting learning. In this paper, we depart from the core emphasis on application and delve into a mostly neglected aspect of the big data conversation in higher education. Drawing on developments in cognate disciplines, we analyse the inherent difficulties in inferring the complex phenomenon that is learning from big datasets. This forms the basis of a discussion about the possibilities for systematic collaboration across different paradigms and disciplinary backgrounds in interpreting big data for enhancing learning. The aim of this paper is to provide the foundation for a research agenda, where differing conceptualisations of learning become a strength in interpreting patterns in big datasets, rather than a point of contention. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Inference; Learning analytics; Predictive modelling; Transdisciplinarity,Big data; Predictive analytics; Cognate disciplines; Higher education; Inference; Learning analytics; Multi-dimensional approach; Predictive modelling; Tools and methods; Transdisciplinarity; Education
Teachers’ perceptions of data management as educational resource: A comparative case study from China and Norway,"Introduction of data-driven tools and practices in education may improve learning but also change education in ways not yet fully understood. Globally, ministries are now beginning to define big data policies for schools. How will this influence the work of teachers, and how do they want to engage with the new sources of information? This study compares two cases from Norway and China, two countries with very different educational systems and cultures, and different implementation policies. In a survey, a hundred primary and secondary school teachers from each country were asked what they wanted to know about their students, and what data they wanted educational big data analysis to be based upon. Qualitative analysis of learning technology infrastructure projects in Tongzhou district in Beijing and in Oslo and national policies provided a backdrop for interpreting the teachers’ answers. Focus group interviews with teachers gave additional insights into the different approaches to educational big data. This study shows that Chinese teachers have a much more open mind and interest for all information data may provide, while Norwegian teachers are more focussed on knowledge acquisition and would like to limit the scope to learning and teaching the curriculum, being concerned about questions related to privacy and data surveillance. Some of these differences could be explained by the differences in context of introducing big data in schools. In China, economic innovation is the driver, while in Norway the pretext for the introduction of learning analytics is adapted education. This study contributes to the knowledge of how data policies will impact on design of learning analytics tools and solutions. Approaches and technologies in this field have a global scope. Therefore, understanding how personal digital data is perceived in different cultural contexts is vital for both development and implementation. © 2020",Big data; Chinese education; comparative case study; educational big data; learning analytics; Norwegian education,
A formalism for plan a big data personal learning assistant for university students,"Big Data-based methods of learning analytics are increasingly relied on by institutions of higher learning in order to increase student retention by identifying at risk students who are in need of an intervention to allow them to continue on in their educational endeavors. It is well known that e-Learning students are even more at risk of failing out of university than are traditional students, so Big Data learning analytics are even more appropriate in this context. In this paper, we present our approach to this problem. We wish to place control of a student’s learning process in his own hands, rather than that of the learning institution in order to decouple the student from the institution since the goals and motivations of these two may not be completely aligned. In this way, we empower the student by giving him control of the personal learning system which employs Big Data techniques to generate recommendations on how to reach a set of learner-specific learning goals. We present the formalism which underlies our system, the architecture which implements the system, scenarios for system use, a survey of related works and thoughts on how the system will be implemented in a prototype in the future. © 2016, Italian e-Learning Association.

Enhancing teaching and learning in educational institutes using the concept of big data technology,"Education system is one of the sectors that experiences changes in terms of technological innovations. Many institutions adopt the use of e-learning platforms and other web services for interactions of the students. Numerous users keep logging into these applications which resulted into supplying huge amount of data. However, despite these huge amount of data, institutions are yet to make use of most of these data. They tend to manage the data submitted by the users regarding their requests only while ignoring data related to web behavioral inputs. Therefore, this paper aimed at providing a model for enhancing teaching and learning in educational institutes using big data technology. The paper has objectives as to identify benefits of big data technology in education, to describe the applications of big data in education and finally to provide big data models for educational system. The paper uses both survey and modelling approaches, the survey makes use of review papers to outline the benefits and applications of big data into education, while the modelling approach uses unified modelling language (UML) to provide description on small data and big data interactions in education system. The small data provide traditional feedback with emphasis on students' performance only, while the big data measures the entire learning process consisting of both students and teachers. © 2018 IEEE.",Big Data; Educational Institutes; Learning Analytics; Teaching and Learning; Web Services,Big data; E-learning; Education computing; Modeling languages; Surveys; Teaching; Web services; Websites; Data interactions; E-learning platforms; Education systems; Educational Institutes; Educational systems; Learning Analytics; Teaching and learning; Technological innovation; Students
"A domain-driven, generative data model for big pet store","Generating large amounts of semantically-rich data for testing big data workflows is paramount for scalable performance benchmarking and quality assurance in modern machine-learning and analytics workloads. The most obvious use case for such a generative algorithm is in conjunction with a big data application blueprint, which can be used by developers (to test their emerging big data solutions) as well as end users (as a starting point for validating infrastructure installations, building novel applications, and learning analytics methods). We present a new domain-driven, generative data model for Big Pet Store, a big data application blueprint for the Hadoop ecosystem included in the Apache Big Top distribution. We describe the model and demonstrate its ability to generate semantically-rich data at variable scale ranging from a single machine to a large cluster. We validate the model by using the generated data to answer questions about customer locations and purchasing habits for a fictional targeted advertising campaign, a common business use case. © 2014 IEEE.",benchmarking; big data; data generation; probabilistic models; synthetic data sets; testing,Benchmarking; Big data; Quality assurance; Testing; Big data applications; Data generation; Generative algorithms; Novel applications; Probabilistic models; Scalable performance; Synthetic datasets; Targeted advertising; Learning systems
Creepy analytics and learner data rights,"Enthusiasm for the potential of learning analytics and big data technologies must be tempered with caution for fundamental learner rights to that data and concern for the ways in which these re-shape the learning environment and the learner-teacher-university relationship.

Toward Machine Learning and Big Data Approaches for Learning Analytics,"There is a paradigm shift in education due to online learning approaches and virtual learning environments. Machine learning methods have been used in a limited manner previously for learning analytics. These models can predict learning outcomes and enable understanding relationships between various learning variables. The data required for such predictions are usually complex with multiple relationships. In this paper, we use Support Vector Regression and Graph representation on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset to provide a view into the use of machine learning methods and graph databases in creating predictive models for bettering the learning approaches. © 2019 IEEE.",graph representation; machine learning; online learning; support vector regression,Big data; Computer aided instruction; Graph Databases; Learning systems; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Support vector regression; Graph representation; Learning approach; Learning outcome; Machine learning methods; Online learning; Open universities; Predictive models; Virtual learning environments; E-learning
Learning analytics: challenges and limitations,"Learning analytic implementations are increasingly being included in learning management systems in higher education. We lay out some concerns with the way learning analytics–both data and algorithms–are often presented within an unproblematized Big Data discourse. We describe some potential problems with the often implicit assumptions about learning and learners–and indeed the tendency not to theorize learning explicitly–that underpin such implementations. Finally, we describe an attempt to devise our own analytics, grounded in a sociomaterial conception of learning. We use the data obtained to suggest that the relationships between learning and the digital traces left by participants in online learning are far from trivial, and that any analytics that relies on these as proxies for learning tends towards a behaviorist evaluation of learning processes. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Big Data; Learning analytics; professional learning; sociomaterial,

Harnessing big data technology to benefit effective delivery and performance maximization in pedagogy,"The Big data concept emerged to meet the growing demands in analysing large volumes of fast moving, heterogeneous and complex data, which traditional data analysis systems could not manage further. The application of big data technology across various sectors of the economy has aided better utilization of multiple data collated and hence decision making. Organizations no longer base operations on assumptions or constructed models solely, but can make inferences from generated data. Educational organizations are more efficient and the pedagogical processes more effective, when multiple streams of data can be collated from the various personnel and facilitators involved. This data when analysed, maximizes the performance of administrators andrecipients alike. This paper looks at the components and techniques in bigdata technology, and how it can be implemented in the education system for effective administration and delivery. © IAEME Publication.",Big data technology; Education; ICT; Learning analytics,
A learning ecosystem for linemen training based on big data components and learning analytics,"Linemen training is mandatory, complex, and hazardous. Electronic technologies, such as virtual reality or learning management systems, have been used to improve such training, however these lack of interoperability, scalability, and do not exploit trace data generated by users in these systems. In this paper we present our ongoing work on developing a Learning Ecosystem for Training Linemen in Maintenance Maneuvers using the Experience API standard, Big Data components, and Learning Analytics. The paper describes the architecture of the ecosystem, elaborates on collecting learning experiences and emotional states, and applies analytics for the exploitation of both, legacy and new data. In the former, we exploit legacy e-Learning data for building a Domain model using Text Mining and unsupervised clustering algorithms. In the latter we explore self-reports capabilities for gathering educational support content, and assessing students emotional states. Results show that, a suitable domain model for personalizing maneuvers linemen training path can be built from legacy text data straightforwardly. Regarding self reports, promising results were obtained for tracking emotional states and collecting educational support material, nevertheless, more work around linemen training is required. © J.UCS.",Big Data; Experience API; Learning Analytics; Learning Ecosystems; Text Mining,
Harnessing the power of big data analytics in the cloud to support learning analytics in mobile learning environment,"Technology enhanced learning (TEL) such as online learning environment with adaptive technologies has gained growing interest in recent past in the field of teaching and learning. In this context, mobile learning has got much momentum and is exemplified by diverse characteristics associated with the technologies and devices used, the enormous size of data generated throughout a learning session, and the interactions among the learners that occur outside the classroom. Consequently, sophisticated data analysis techniques are required to handle the intricacy of mobile learning and analyze the vast amount of datasets to enhance the learning experiences of mobile learners. This has led to the adoption of big data analytics for efficient processing of big learning data to add value to the mobile learning environments. Yet limited processing capability of the mobile devices is another key challenge faced by such big data analytics in mobile learning environments. To overcome this limitation, certain heavy computational parts could be offloaded to the cloud which can provide enough computation and storage resources. To this end, this paper presents a cloud based mobile learning framework that utilizes big data analytics technique to extract values from huge volume of mobile learners' data. Finally, we investigate learners' readiness and driving factors of mobile learning adoption in higher education institutions. In particular, we propose a hypothesized model for mobile learning adoption built on a locally extended technology acceptance model (TAM). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Big data analytics; Cloud computing; Learning analytics; Map-reduce technique; Mobile learning (m-learning); Technology acceptance model (TAM),Big data; Cloud computing; Computer aided instruction; Data mining; Digital storage; Engineering education; Learning systems; Online systems; Teaching; Big Data Analytics; Learning analytics; M-Learning; Map-reduce; Technology acceptance model; E-learning; adoption; article; cloud computing; human; human experiment; learning environment
Proposed 4SM Model for Indian Education System Implementing Big Data Analytics and Blended Learning Methods,"With the technology at the center of much uproar and improvising these days, the application of big data and blended learning in the current Indian education system is the need of the hour. It has been observed that the data is growing at a fast pace, therefore there must be certain techniques which will help to improve the conventional teaching methods in order to tackle with the young minds curiosities. To address the issue, a new educational model called 4-Step-Model is proposed. It can be used in parallel that support both the online and traditional face-to-face learning.

Closing the loop of big data analytics: The case of learning analytics,"Much of the literature on business analytics assumes a straightforward relationship from human behaviour to data and from data to analytical insights that can be used to steer operations. At the same time, more critical scholars have suggested that the implications of big data analytics can go beyond improved decision making, sometimes twisting or even undermining managerial efforts. We adapt a theory of reactivity, originally developed to study university rankings, to identify various unintended effects of the application of big data analytics in an organizational setting. More specifically, we study the perceptions of a sophisticated learning analytics system among staff members of an internationally recognized business school. We find evidence for four reactive effects: re-allocation of resources, change in values, redefinition of work and practices, and gaming, and map these to four underlying reactive mechanisms: commensuration, self-fulfilling prophecies, reverse engineering and narratives. The study contributes toward theoretically broader, but also more practical understanding of big data analytics: reactivity may dilute the methodological validity of analytics to describe organisational and business environment for managerial purposes, yet the understanding of reactive effects makes a more potent use of analytics possible in organisational settings. © 26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018.

Teaching case who renews? Who leaves? Identifying customer churn in a telecom company using big data techniques,"Within the context of the telecom industry, this teaching case is an active learning analytics exercise to help students build hands-on expertise on how to utilize Big Data to solve a business problem. Particularly, the case utilizes an analytics method to help develop a customer retention strategy to mitigate against an increasing customer churn problem in a telecom company. Traditionally, the forecast of customer churn uses various demographic and cell phone usage data. Big Data techniques permit a much finer granularity in the prediction of churn by analyzing specific activities a customer undertakes before churning. The authors help students to understand how data from customer interactions with the company through multiple channels can be combined to create a ""session."" Subsequently, the authors demonstrate the use of effective visualization to identify the most relevant paths to customer churn.

Data sharing for learning analytics - Questioning the risks and benefits,"Moving learning analytics from the research labs to the classrooms and lecture halls requires data sharing. Data are not any longer gathered in controlled settings but have to be combined from different sources within the institution and maybe beyond. This scaling up of learning analytics raises a host of questions on behalf of the data subjects providing requirements for design of new solutions and practices. This paper analyses a corpus of more than 200 questions gathered by a European learning analytics support action and explores how these questions could be used to understand the problem space of data sharing and the solution space to be carved out by research and development within this emerging field of learning technologies. The paper concludes the discussion on data sharing and big data for education is still at an early stage, where conceptual issues dominate and there is a long way to go before one can move towards solving issues of technical development and implementation.",Interoperability; Learning analytics; Questioning,Big data; Interoperability; Learning analytics; Learning technology; New solutions; Paper analysis; Questioning; Research and development; Solution space; Technical development; Education

The skinny on big data in education: Learning analytics simplified,"This paper examines the current state of learning analytics (LA), its stakeholders and the benefits and challenges these stakeholders face. LA is a field of research that involves the gathering, analyzing and reporting of data related to learners and their environments with the purpose of optimizing the learning experience. Stakeholders in LA are students, educators, researchers, institutions, and government agencies. The way in which analytics information flows from students to other stakeholders involves a hierarchy, where all stakeholders are able to provide input and offer recommendations to enrich the learning process for the student. Challenges faced by stakeholders include the movement of traditional analytics to learner-centered analytics, working with datasets across various settings, addressing issues with technology and resolving ethical concerns. Despite these challenges, research points to solutions that will allow LA to transform teaching and learning. © 2015, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.",big data; learning analytics; trends in education,
Learning analytics as assemblage: Criticality and contingency in online education,"Recently, the possibilities for leveraging ''big data'' in research and pedagogy have given rise to the growing field of ''learning analytics'' in online education. While much of this work has focused on quantitative metrics, some have called for critical perspectives that interrogate such data as an interplay between technical infrastructures and contingent social practices. Following such calls, this article conceptualizes ''learning analytics'' as an assemblage of technical, designed, and sociocognitive dimensions. Drawing on DeLanda's articulation of assemblage theory, we examine the ways online learning unfolds within and across these scales by using illustrative quantitative and qualitative data-click-data, user-generated content, and student interviews-from three online higher education courses. We consider how insights generated from such a stance might contribute to critical perspectives on how power circulates in online learning environments-A framework we call ''critical learning analytics.'' We conclude by offering some possibilities for which such a framework might be put to use-not only to map learning analytics as assemblage, but also to imagine how they might be assembled otherwise to promote more ethical instruction and more equitable student flourishing. © 2017 The Author(s).",Assemblage theory; Big data; Critical education; Higher education; Learning analytics; Online learning,

Making sense of learner and learning Big Data: reviewing five years of Data Wrangling at the Open University UK,"Most distance learning institutions collect vast amounts of learning data. Making sense of this ‘Big Data’ can be a challenge, in particular when data are stored at different data warehouses and require advanced statistical skills to interpret complex patterns of data. As a leading institute on learning analytics, the Open University UK instigated in 2012 a Data Wrangling initiative. This provided every Faculty with a dedicated academic with expertise data analysis and whose task is to provide strategic, pedagogical and sense-making advice to staff and senior management. Given substantial changes within the OU (e.g. new Faculty structure, real-time dashboards, two large-scale adoptions of predictive analytics approaches, increased reliance on analytics), this embedded case study provides an in-depth review of lessons learned of five years of data wrangling.

"Student attitudes toward learning analytics in higher education: ""The fitbit version of the learning world""","Increasingly, higher education institutions are exploring the potential of learning analytics to predict student retention, understand learning behaviors, and improve student learning through providing personalized feedback and support. The technical development of learning analytics has outpaced consideration of ethical issues surrounding their use. Of particular concern is the absence of the student voice in decision-making about learning analytics. We explored higher education students' knowledge, attitudes, and concerns about big data and learning analytics through four focus groups (N = 41). Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts identified six key themes. The first theme, ""Uninformed and Uncertain,"" represents students' lack of knowledge about learning analytics prior to the focus groups. Following the provision of information, viewing of videos and discussion of learning analytics scenarios three further themes; ""Help or Hindrance to Learning,"" ""More than a Number,"" and ""Impeding Independence"" represented students' perceptions of the likely impact of learning analytics on their learning. ""Driving Inequality"" and ""Where Will it Stop"" represent ethical concerns raised by the students about the potential for inequity, bias and invasion of privacy and the need for informed consent. A key tension to emerge was how ""personal"" vs. ""collective"" purposes or principles can intersect with ""uniform"" vs. ""autonomous"" activity.

Early-Stage Engagement: Applying Big Data Analytics on Collaborative Learning Environment for Measuring Learners' Engagement Rate,"Computer-supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is a pedagogical strategy associated with how learners construct knowledge with a group by computer-based learning system. In recent years, most of the computer-based learning systems record the interaction log of each learner when developing course assignments. However, the recorded data is facing a challenge to expose the learners behaviors during the course and to design a computer-supported collaborative learning activity. To address those challenges in this paper, a novel collaborative programming tool called Software Project Development and Insight Learning Environment (SPDI Learning Environment) is described. The SPDI Learning environment allows learners of computer science to develop course assignments collaboratively. Besides, it allows instructors to investigate the learners behaviors by associating a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) with Big Data analysis pipeline and Visualization Dashboard. In addition to collect real data from courses, we designed learning activities to help teachers to engage the field of CSCL and Learning Analytics. © 2016 IEEE.",Big-Data Analysis; Clickstream Data; Collaborative Programming; Computer-supported Collaborative Learning; Learning Analytics,Big data; Computer aided instruction; Computer programming; Computer supported cooperative work; Curricula; Data handling; Data visualization; Deep neural networks; Education; Engineering research; Information analysis; Learning systems; Teaching; Clickstream data; Collaborative learning environment; Collaborative programming; Computer Supported Collaborative Learning; Computer-based learning systems; Integrated development environment; Learning Analytics; Pedagogical strategies; E-learning
"A middle-school module for introducing data-mining, big-data, ethics and privacy using rapidminer and a Hollywood theme","Today's organizations, including online businesses, use the art of data-driven decision-making i.e. business-intelligence (BI) to benefit from all the data out in the open. Given the current market demand for BI skill-sets, including the knowledge of different sources and tools for data-collection plus processing, today's youth need a basic understanding of data-driven intelligence, and an awareness of big-data related ethics and privacy. However, there has been limited research and development work towards designing an effective educational module in this regard at the K-12 level. We intend to address this particular limitation by presenting a uniquely engaging middle-school learning module based upon a combination of useful topics, like data-mining, predictive-analytics, data-visualization, big-data, ethics and privacy, using the free RapidMiner softwaretool. The novelty of our module lies in the use of a GUI-based visual hands-on platform (RapidMiner), a Hollywood movie-theme based educational activity, as well as an added focus on big-data ethics and privacy, and its conceptual mapping to the NSA-GenCyber security-first principles. We discuss and analyze the survey data obtained from over hundred participants through several offerings of our module as an educational workshop through our Google-IgniteCS and NSA-GenCyber programs. The collected learning-analytics data indicate that our module can become a simple yet effective means for introducing data-mining, big-data, ethical and privacy issues, and GenCyber security-first principles at the middle-school level. Our results show prospects of motivating middle-school participants towards further learning of topics in data-science, data-ethics and data-security, which is necessary today in a variety of professions. © 2018 Association of Computing Machinery.",,Data mining; Data privacy; Data visualization; Decision making; Education computing; Philosophical aspects; Predictive analytics; Surveys; Conceptual mapping; Data driven decision; Educational activities; Educational workshops; First principles; Learning analytics; Learning modules; Research and development; Big data
Emotion analysis meets learning analytics - Online learner profiling beyond numerical data,"Learning analytics is an emerging field of research, which deals with collecting and analysing data about learners and their learning context, as well as developing solutions that utilise the analysed data. Traditionally, learning analytics methods focus on the analysis of learners' digital trails or numerical big data, e.g., online material access, digital learners' records, grades, and length of interaction with the learning environment. However, profiling a learner without taking into account the emotional aspects that may hinder the learner's progress, can only offer an incomplete view of the learning experience. Hence, in this paper, we elaborate on the fusion of emotional aspects (i.e., emotion data) and learning analytics, specifically in online learning settings. We bring an open discussion to the educational technology community regarding the potential of analysing learner's emotions from pedagogical texts (i.e., non-structured text data) generated during an online course. We also discuss the role of negative emotions during learning, the ethical issues with the use of emotion data and the technology acceptance and reliability.

Bridging learning analytics and Cognitive Computing for Big Data classification in micro-learning video collections,"Moving towards the next generation of personalized learning environments requires intelligent approaches powered by analytics for advanced learning contexts with enriched digital content. Micro-Learning through Massive Open Online Courses is riding the wave of popularity as a novel paradigm for delivering short educational videos in small pre-organized chunks over time, so that learners can get knowledge in a manageable way. However, with the ever-increasing number of videos, it has become challenging to arrange and search them according to specific categories. In this paper, we get around the problem by bridging Learning Analytics and Cognitive Computing to analyze the content of large video collections, going over traditional term-based methods. We propose an efficient and effective approach to automatically classify a collection of educational videos on pre-existing categories which uses (i) a Speech-to-Text tool to get video transcripts, (ii) Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing methods to extract semantic concepts and keywords from video transcripts for their representation, and (iii) Apache Spark as Big Data technology for scalability. Several classifiers are trained on the feature vectors extracted by Cognitive Computing tools. Then, we compared our approach with other combinations of state-of-the-art feature types and classifiers over a large-scale dataset we collected from Coursera. Considering the experimental results, we expect our approach can facilitate the development of Learning Analytics tools powered by Cognitive Computing to support content managers on micro-learning video management while improving how learners search videos. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Big Data technologies; Cognitive Computing; Learning Analytics; Micro-learning video; Multi-class classification; Video classification,Big data; Classifiers; Computer aided instruction; Data mining; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Big data technologies; Cognitive Computing; Learning analytics; Micro-learning; Multi-class classification; Video classification; Classification (of information); article; classification; classifier; controlled study; genetic transcription; human; human experiment; learning; manager; natural language processing; speech; videorecording
Workflow analytics for improving healthcare learning processes,"Big data technology promises to transform the way in which medical care is delivered and to lead healthcare professionals to safer and more accurate diagnosis and focused treatments. Hence, healthcare professionals should increase their reliance on big data technology for diagnosis and decision making. In order to support this transformation in medical practice, healthcare professionals will need to be trained in big data usage and also to be guided and supported, during the whole learning process. Process-oriented e-learning systems seem to be ideal for healthcare professionals' training as they introduce flexible learning pathways so they can progress through the content in a variety of ways based on their needs and preferences. In such a workflow-based e-learning environment, Learning Analytics enhances the concept of ""personalized learning"", and thus, promises to provide improved learning outcomes by monitoring and predicting healthcare professionals' learning performance and enabling trainers to tailor training to each healthcare professional's level of need and ability. To this end, this paper presents a Learning Analytics approach for gaining insight into healthcare professionals' learning progress and evaluating the learning process in a workflow-based e-learning environment.

University Teachers' and students' expectations on learning analytics,"Learning analytics (LA) is a promising tool to support learning and retention in studies; so far, many applications have been developed to make use of big data saved automatically while using online learning management systems. However, it is not clear how different applications support the contemporary learning approach or how they are valued by both teachers and students. Therefore, a qualitative study was conducted to explore university teachers' and students' expectations on LA. Several scenarios were provided to them in order to feed their ideas about the potential of LA. The results were linked to the characteristics of the contemporary learning approach. This showed that while self-regulation is the most often supported objective enhanced by LA, collaboration skills and subjective well-being need much more attention. It was also found that students were more positive than teachers in starting to use LA and teachers' opinions varied greatly. © 2018 IEEE.",Big data; Contemporary learning approach; Learning analytics; Qualitative analysis; Scenario based approach; Small data,Big data; Information management; Online systems; Students; Learning analytics; Learning approach; Qualitative analysis; Scenario-based; Small data; Teaching
"Comparing MOOC-based platforms: Reflection on pedagogical support, framework and learning analytics","The rapidly expanding, highly evolving online course market (Massive Open Online Course or MOOC) is influential in academia. Many well-known MOOC platforms have emerged over the last decade. There is a need to compare the support level offered by these platforms so that educators can deliver materials and students are able to learn better. Additionally, there is a need to explore what kinds of data are gathered from these platforms to exploit big data analytics opportunities. This paper evaluates three major online MOOC course providers namely Coursera, EdX, and Udacity. We first compare these platforms in terms of pedagogical support and implemented technologies. We then look at the literature and compare learning analytics support among these tools that are currently offered. We also suggest a set of analytics concepts that can aid instructors to mine student's interaction data and generate guidance for effective teaching. © 2015 IEEE.",Coursera; EdX; Learning analytics; MOOC; Udacity,Big data; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Teaching; Coursera; Data analytics; Effective teaching; Learning analytics; Massive open online course; MOOC; Pedagogical supports; Udacity; E-learning
Advanced distributed learning partnership laboratory,"The rapid expansion of information and communication technologies in relation to big data analysis generates the vital demand to gain the maximum benefit of the 'big data'. Business intelligence and learning analytics are recently drawing considerable attention in market and society being one of the most competitive and profitable areas of interest to businesses and organizations, including higher education institutions. Business intelligence systems have already demonstrated significant impact on strategic decision making and trends forecasting. Learning analytics is going to extend the value of business intelligence in the field of education and training in proportion to retention, students' success and satisfaction. Hence, the overall organization's performance and ranking-in a wider scope-will be transformed toward informed, timelier, high-valued, evidenced and high-quality decisions benefiting the students, and accordingly, achieving sustainable organization's performance in a middle term, and society advancement in a longer term. This paper focuses on investigating the potential of business intelligence approaches toward a meaningful analysis of the organization's and student's experience by making use of business intelligence enhanced learning analytics. It provides valuable insights into the integration and use of business intelligence in the learning analytics application area by highlighting recent research and developments. Furthermore, it suggests paths to resolving current issues in the interrelationship between higher education institutions' and learning performance by designing a novel closed-loop feedback framework that aims at improving the learning outcomes for the students, and the organization, and prepares for smart educational management. © 2018 IEEE.",Business intelligence; Datadriven learning; Educational management; Learning analytics,Big data; Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Information analysis; Advanced distributed learning; Business intelligence systems; Datadriven learning; Educational management; Higher education institutions; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning analytics; Strategic decision making; Students
Using “big data” to guide implementation of a web and mobile adaptive learning platform for medical students,"Background: Adaptive learning platforms (ALPs) can revolutionize medical education by making learning more efficient, but their potential has not been realized because students do not use them persistently. Methods: We applied educational data mining methods to study United States medical students who used an ALP called Osmosis (www.osmosis.org) from 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015. Multivariate logistic regressions modeled persistence on Osmosis as the dependent variable and Osmosis-collected variables as predictors. Results: The 6787 students included in our analysis responded to a total of 887,193 items, with 2138 (31.5%) using Osmosis persistently. Number of items per student, mobile device use, subscription payment, and group membership were independently associated with persisting (p < 0.001 in all models). Persistent users rated quality more favorably (p < 0.01) but were not more confident in answer selections (p = 0.80). While persisters were more accurate than non-persisters (55% (SD 18%) vs 52% (SD 22%), p < 0.001), after adjusting for number of items, lower accuracy was associated with persistent use (OR 0.93 [95% CI 0.90–0.97], p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our study of a large sample of U.S. medical students illustrates big data medical education research and provides guidance for improving implementation of ALPs and further investigation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"data mining; dependent variable; human; learning; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; medical education; medical student; model; osmosis; United States; data mining; Internet; procedures; Data Mining; Education, Medical; Humans; Internet; Learning; Students, Medical"

"Collect, scope, and verify big data - A framework for institution accreditation","Institutions in higher education generate terabytesof data that has great value to shape future of nations. This Big Data is in heterogeneous formats, very current, and in large volumes. We propose a framework to collect, scope and verify this large amount of data. Although the framework is explained in the context of institution accreditation in higher education, the framework can be applied in the fields of health-care, finance, marketing etc. Our framework is used to reduce human involvement in the collection and analysis of data, for the purpose of accreditation. The framework extends the scope of data collected to target the heterogeneous nature of the data. Finally, our framework helps to verify the data against a standard set by an accreditation body. © 2016 IEEE.",Big Data; Higher Education; Learning Analytics,Accreditation; Education; Analysis of data; Higher education; Large amounts; Large volumes; Learning Analytics; Big data
Educational Stream Data Analysis: A Case Study,"Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are Web-based platforms where educational contents, together with study support tools, are provided. Logs recording the interactions between students and VLEs are collected on a daily basis, thus automatic techniques are needed to manage and analyze such huge quantities of data. Students, teachers, managers, and in general all stakeholders involved in the VLEs' learning activities, can take advantage of the insights coming from educational data and useful information can be extracted by using machine learning techniques. Traditionally, educational data have been studied as stationary data by using conventional machine learning methods. However, educational data are non-stationary by nature and they can be better treated as data streams. In this paper, we show the results of a classification study where the random forest algorithm, applied both in batch and adaptive mode, is used to develop a model for predicting the failure/success of students' exams. Moreover, a feature importance analysis is carried out to detect the most discriminant attributes for the predictive task. Experiments were performed on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) showing the reliability of adaptive random forest in creating accurate classification models from evolving educational data. © 2020 IEEE.",adaptive learning; big data analytics; educational data mining; machine learning; online courses; OULAD; stream data mining,Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; Data streams; Decision trees; Information use; Machine learning; Random forests; Automatic technique; Classification models; Conventional machines; Educational contents; Importance analysis; Machine learning techniques; Random forest algorithm; Virtual learning environments (VLEs); Students

Scalable Cloud-Based Analysis Framework for Medical Big-Data,"Medical care can be improved by efficient analysis of the large amounts of data involved in patient care. Two important challenges for patient care big-data analysis are the need to cope with unstructured images and text (as well as structured data) and the need for efficient methods that scale for large amounts of data generated by the many patients. The framework described here is designed to cope with these challenges. Firstly it is composed of generic components where the initial stage can transform unstructured image or text data into a set of features for the latter stages. Secondly the machine learning analytics engine incorporates three optimizations which allow the framework to scale and deal with large amounts of unstructured data. The framework is evaluated using both image and text data, and shown to provide an efficient scalable solution. © 2016 IEEE.",Big Data; Cloud-based Big Data Analytics; Machine Learning; Medical; Scable Framework,Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Learning systems; Analysis frameworks; Data analytics; Efficient analysis; Generic components; Large amounts of data; Medical; Scable Framework; Unstructured data; Big data

Application of machine learning in predicting performance for computer engineering students: A case study,"The present work proposes the application of machine learning techniques to predict the final grades (FGs) of students based on their historical performance of grades. The proposal was applied to the historical academic information available for students enrolled in the computer engineering degree at an Ecuadorian university. One of the aims of the university's strategic plan is the development of a quality education that is intimately linked with sustainable development goals (SDGs). The application of technology in teaching-learning processes (Technology-enhanced learning) must become a key element to achieve the objective of academic quality and, as a consequence, enhance or benefit the common good. Today, both virtual and face-to-face educational models promote the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in both teaching-learning processes and academic management processes. This implementation has generated an overload of data that needs to be processed properly in order to transform it into valuable information useful for all those involved in the field of education. Predicting a student's performance from their historical grades is one of the most popular applications of educational data mining and, therefore, it has become a valuable source of information that has been used for different purposes. Nevertheless, several studies related to the prediction of academic grades have been developed exclusively for the benefit of teachers and educational administrators. Little or nothing has been done to show the results of the prediction of the grades to the students. Consequently, there is very little research related to solutions that help students make decisions based on their own historical grades. This paper proposes a methodology in which the process of data collection and pre-processing is initially carried out, and then in a second stage, the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic performance was carried out. In the next phase, based on the identified patterns, the most appropriate supervised learning algorithm was selected, and then the experimental process was carried out. Finally, the results were presented and analyzed. The results showed the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to predict the performance of students. © 2019 by the authors.",Big data; Educational data mining; Learning analytics; Machine learning; Prediction grades,academic performance; computer system; data acquisition; data assimilation; data mining; higher education; prediction; student; supervised learning
Learning analytics platform in higher education in Japan,"In recent years, learning analytics has become a hot topic with many institutes deploying learning management systems and learning analytics tools. In this paper, we introduce learning analytics platforms that have been established in two top national Japanese universities. These initiatives are part of a broader research project into creating wide-reaching learning analytics frameworks. The aim of the project is to support education and learning through research into educational big data accumulated on these platforms. We also discuss the future direction of our research into learning analytics platforms. This includes introducing a model in which learning analytics tools and the results of research can be shared between different education institutes. © 2018 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited.

Privacy engineering for learning analytics in a global market: Defining a point of reference,"Purpose: Privacy is a culturally universal process; however, in the era of Big Data privacy is handled very differently in different parts of the world. This is a challenge when designing tools and approaches for the use of Educational Big Data (EBD) and learning analytics (LA) in a global market. The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of information privacy in a cross-cultural setting to define a common point of reference for privacy engineering. Design/methodology/approach: The paper follows a conceptual exploration approach. Conceptual work on privacy in EBD and LA in China and the west is contrasted with the general discussion of privacy in a large corpus of literature and recent research. As much of the discourse on privacy has an American or European bias, intimate knowledge of Chinese education is used to test the concept of privacy and to drive the exploration of how information privacy is perceived in different cultural and educational settings. Findings: The findings indicate that there are problems using privacy concepts found in European and North-American theories to inform privacy engineering for a cross-cultural market in the era of Big Data. Theories based on individualism and ideas of control of private information do not capture current global digital practice. The paper discusses how a contextual and culture-aware understanding of privacy could be developed to inform privacy engineering without letting go of universally shared values. The paper concludes with questions that need further research to fully understand information privacy in education. Originality/value: As far as the authors know, this paper is the first attempt to discuss – from a comparative and cross-cultural perspective – information privacy in an educational context in the era of Big Data. The paper presents initial explorations of a problem that needs urgent attention if good intentions of privacy supportive educational technologies are to be turned into more than political slogans. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cross-cultural studies; Educational Big Data; Information privacy; Learning analytics; Privacy engineering,
A Pedagogical Perspective on Big Data and Learning Analytics: A Conceptual Model for Digital Learning Support,"The increasing prevalence of learner-centred forms of learning as well as an increase in the number of learners actively participating on a wide range of digital platforms and devices give rise to an ever-increasing stream of learning data. Learning analytics (LA) can enable learners, teachers, and their institutions to better understand and predict learning and performance. However, the pedagogical perspective and matters of learning design have been underrepresented in research thus far. In our paper, we propose a general design framework that includes critical dimensions of LA and assists in creating LA services that support educational practice. On the basis of a two-dimensional framework (individual vs. social, reflection vs. prediction), we then identify four generic approaches to LA aimed at improving learning process and learning outcomes. To demonstrate the application, four use cases are outlined that are based on four previously elaborated generic approaches to LA. Finally, we discuss the validation of the model and close with an outlook on relevant future research. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Digital learning support; Learning analytics; Learning analytics taxonomy; Social learning analytics,Big data; Digital devices; Learning systems; Conceptual model; Critical dimension; Digital platforms; Digital-learning; Generic approach; Improving learning; Learning analytics; Social learning; E-learning
Big data and academic libraries: The quest for informed decision-making,"Libraries remain one of the last places on campus where the purging of usage data is encouraged and “tracking” is a dirty word.

Indeed, the 2013-2014 Academic Affairs Committee Report included a ""Learning Analytics in Pharmacy Education"" section that reviewed the potential benefits of adopting big data techniques.1 Likewise, the 2014-2015 Argus Commission Report discussed uses for big data analytics in the classroom, practice, and admissions.2 While both of these reports were thorough, neither discussed specific analytic techniques. Consequently, this commentary will introduce classification trees, with a particular emphasis on their use in admission. With electronic applications, pharmacy schools and colleges now have access to detailed applicant records containing thousands of observations. With declining applications nationwide, admissions analytics may be more important than ever.3.",admissions; decision tree; predictive analytics,"education; human; pharmacy school; pharmacy student; procedures; United States; Education, Pharmacy; Humans; Schools, Pharmacy; Students, Pharmacy; United States"
Regulating “big data education” in europe: Lessons learned from the US,"European schools are increasingly relying on vendors to collect, process, analyse, and even make decisions based on a considerable amount of student data through big data tools and methods. Consequently, portions of school’s power are gradually shifting from traditional public schools to the hands of for-profit organisations. This article discusses the current and forthcoming European Union (EU) data protection regime with respect to the protection of student rights from the potential risk of outsourcing student data utilisation in Kindergarten-12th grade (K-12) educational systems.

Grade prediction of weekly assignments in MOOCS: mining video-viewing behavior,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) hold the promise of democratizing the learning process. However, providing effective feedback has proven hard to offer at scale since most methods require a teacher or tutor. Leveraging big data in MOOCs offers a mechanism to develop predictive models that can inform computer-based pedagogical tutors. We review research on grade prediction and examine the predictive power of a model based on user video-watching behavior. In a MOOC organized around weekly assignments, we find that frequency of video viewing per week is a better predictor than individual viewing features such as plays, pauses, seeking, and rate changes. This finding is useful for MOOCs that use assignments for course evaluations in addition or to the exclusion of in-video quizzes for formative assessment. Engaging, well-crafted assignments in MOOCs have the potential of boosting student retention and course completion by fostering a deeper understanding through application and practice. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Course Grades; Course Performance; Educational Data Mining; Explanation Analysis; Machine Learning; MOOCs; Prediction Analysis,

The logic of data-sense: thinking through Learning Personalisation,"Big Data and Learning Analytics’ promise to revolutionise educational institutions, endeavours, and actions through more and better data is now compelling. Multiple, and continually updating, data sets produce a new sense of ‘personalised learning’. A crucial attribute of the datafication, and subsequent profiling, of learner behaviour and engagement is the continual modification of the learning environment to induce greater levels of investment on the parts of each learner. The assumption is that more and better data, gathered faster and fed into ever-updating algorithms, provide more complete tools to understand, and therefore improve, learning experiences through adaptive personalisation. The argument in this paper is that Learning Personalisation names a new logistics of investment as the common ‘sense’ of the school, in which disciplinary education is ‘both disappearing and giving way to frightful continual training, to continual monitoring'. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Big data; Deleuze; learning; learning analytics; personalisation,

"Who owns educational theory? Big data, algorithms and the expert power of education data science","‘Education data science’ is an emerging methodological field which possesses the algorithm-driven technologies required to generate insights and knowledge from educational big data. This article consists of an analysis of the Lytics Lab, Stanford University’s laboratory for research and development in learning analytics, and the Center for Digital Data, Analytics and Adaptive Learning, a big data research centre of the commercial education company Pearson. These institutions are becoming methodological gatekeepers with the capacity to conduct new forms of educational research using big data and algorithmic data science methods. The central argument is that as educational data science has migrated from the academic lab to the commercial sector, ownership of the means to produce educational data analyses has become concentrated in the activities of for-profit companies. As a consequence, new theories of learning are being built-in to the tools they provide, in the shape of algorithm-driven technologies of personalization, which can be sold to schools and universities. The paper addresses two themes of this special issue: (1) how education is to be theorized in relation to algorithmic methods and data scientific epistemologies and (2) how the political economy of education is shifting as knowledge production becomes concentrated in data-driven commercial organizations. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Algorithms; big data; data science; educational data science; educational research; methodology,
Learning analytics considered harmful,"This essay is written to present a prospective stance on how learning analytics, as a core evaluative approach, must help instructors uncover the important trends and evidence of quality learner data in the online course. A critique is presented of strategic and tactical issues of learning analytics. The approach to the critique is taken through the lens of questioning the current status of applying learning analytics to online courses. The goal of the discussion is twofold: (1) to inform online learning practitioners (e.g., instructors and administrators) of the potential of learning analytics in online courses and (2) to broaden discussion in the research community about the advancement of learning analytics in online learning. In recognizing the full potential of formalizing big data in online courses, the community must address this issue also in the context of the potentially ""harmful"" application of learning analytics.",Effectiveness; Evaluation; Learning analytics; Online learning; Participation patterns; Threaded discussions,
A scalable heterogeneous big data framework for e-learning systems,"—The adoption of e-learning systems in higher education is a remarkable phenomenon that has redefined teaching and learning. Initially, it was proposed to allow people to learn for personal accomplishment without physically attending any traditional university or academic settings. While these systems continue to provide an efficient and flexible approach for teaching and learning, the rapid integration of ICTs and the expansion of data from these systems remain much concern to the education community. In this study, we propose a smart and secure data flow architectural framework for e-learning that uses a rich set of big data tools within a distributed and parallel analysis platform. Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) reference model guided the development of this Big Data framework for e-learning analytics. Using the RM-ODP model as a benchmark, we classify the educational institution’s architecture in terms of existing elements, functions and processes to understand stakeholders’ views for the development of the framework. Our approach uses an existing distributed computing environment and of fers an adaptable standard framework to improve the data acquisition, storage, processing, analysis, security and virtualization for e-learning systems. We implement a scalable and adaptable big data framework for e-learning (BiDeL) and point out how big data concept could integrate into online learning systems to improve teaching and learning in higher education using Apache Spark as a case. The proposed framework was applied to both batch and streaming dataset of students online activities on moodle LMSs. BiDel framework performance shows improved data integration and data governance. This big data framework and the general view of the current state of the art in “big data” technologies will serve as a guide for the creation of e-learning systems, which create new value from existing but underused data. The acquired value will provide decision-makers in higher education with new insights from data to enhance productivity in teaching and learning. These insights can lead to innovation, competitiveness in the academic space and even create entirely new teaching and learning models. ©2020 IEEE.",Big Data framework; E-Learning; Higher education; Online Learning; RM-ODP,
A bibliometric perspective of learning analytics research landscape,"Learning analytics is an emerging field of research, motivated by the wide spectrum of the available educational information that can be analysed to provide a data-driven decision about various learning problems. This study intends to examine the research landscape of learning analytics to deliver a comprehensive understanding of the research activities in this multidisciplinary field, using scientific literature from the Scopus database. An array of state-of-the-art bibliometric indices is deployed on 2811 procured publication datasets: publication counts, citation counts, co-authorship patterns, citation networks and term co-occurrence. The results indicate that the field of learning analytics appears to have been instantiated around 2011; thus, before this time period no significant research activity can be observed. The temporal evolution indicates that the terms ‘students’, ‘teachers’, ‘higher education institutions’ and ‘learning process’ appear to be the major components of the field. More recent trends in the field are the tools that tap into Big Data analytics and data mining techniques for more rational data-driven decision-making services. A future direction research depicts a need to integrate learning analytics research with multidisciplinary smart education and smart library services. The vision towards smart city research requires a meta-level of smart learning analytics value integration and policy-making. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",academic analytics; bibliometrics; decision-making; educational analytics; Learning analytics,Data mining; Decision making; Teaching; academic analytics; Bibliometric indices; Bibliometrics; Data driven decision; educational analytics; Higher education institutions; Learning analytics; Scientific literature; Big data; article; bibliometrics; data mining; decision making; education; human; human experiment; landscape; learning; management; publication; scientific literature; Scopus; student; teacher; vision; writing
Applying learning analytics for the early prediction of students' academic performance in blended learning,"Blended learning combines online digital resources with traditional classroom activities and enables students to attain higher learning performance through well-defined interactive strategies involving online and traditional learning activities. Learning analytics is a conceptual framework and as a part of our Precision education used to analyze and predict students' performance and provide timely interventions based on student learning profiles. This study applied learning analytics and educational big data approaches for the early prediction of students' final academic performance in a blended Calculus course. Real data with 21 variables were collected from the proposed course, consisting of video-viewing behaviors, out-of-class practice behaviors, homework and quiz scores, and after-school tutoring. This study applied principal component regression to predict students' final academic performance. The experimental results show that students' final academic performance could be predicted when only one-third of the semester had elapsed. In addition, we identified seven critical factors that affect students' academic performance, consisting of four online factors and three traditional factors. The results showed that the blended data set combining online and traditional critical factors had the highest predictive performance. © 2018, International Forum of Educational Technology and Society.",Blended learning; Educational big data; Learning analytics; MOOCs; Principal component regression,
Combining observational and experiential data to inform the redesign of learning activities,"A main goal for learning analytics is to inform the design of a learning experience to improve its quality. The increasing presence of solutions based on big data has even questioned the validity of current scientific methods. Is this going to happen in the area of learning analytics? In this paper we postulate that if changes are driven solely by a digital footprint, there is a risk of focusing only on factors that are directly connected to numeric methods. However, if the changes are complemented with an understanding about how students approach their learning, the quality of the evidence used in the redesign is significantly increased. This reasoning is illustrated with a case study in which an initial set of activities for a first year engineering course were shaped based only on the student's digital footprint. These activities were significantly modified after collecting qualitative data about the students approach to learning. We conclude the paper arguing that the interpretation of the meaning of learning analytics is improved when combined with qualitative data which reveals how and why students engaged with the learning tasks in qualitatively different ways, which together provide a more informed basis for designing learning activities.",Active learning; Approaches to learning; Interventions; Learning analytics; Mixed methods analysis,Artificial intelligence; Case based reasoning; Students; Active Learning; Approaches to learning; Interventions; Learning analytics; Mixed method; Big data
Exploiting social judgements in big data analytics,"Social judgements like comments, reviews, discussions, or ratings have become a ubiquitous component of most Web applications, especially in the e-commerce domain. Now, a central challenge is using these judgements to improve the user experience by offering new query paradigms or better data analytics. Recommender systems have already demonstrated how ratings can be effectively used towards that end, allowing users to semantically explore even large item databases. In this paper, we will discuss how to use unstructured reviews to build a structured semantic representation of database items, enabling the implementation of semantic queries and further machine-learning analytics. Thus, we address one of the central challenge of Big Data: making sense of huge collections of unstructured user feedback.

Big data learning analytics and algorithmic decision-making in digital education governance,"This article reviews and advances existing literature concerning digital education governance. Building my argument by drawing on data collected from Cowen, Deloitte, Forbes, Global Market Insights, Ironpaper, LinkedIn Talent Solutions, and Statista, I performed analyses and made estimates regarding U.S. artificial intelligence in education market share (by end-use, $ million), how smartphone users benefit from AI: awareness and usage of smartphone applications featuring machine learning (predictive text/route suggestions/ voice assistants/voice search/translation apps/voice-to-text/email classification/ automated calendar entries/location-based app suggestions/automated photo classification), industries with the most machine learning talent, ranked by percentage of the total machine learning talent pool (higher education and research/IT and computer software/Internet/ finance and banking/management consulting), sectors targeted by machine learning application developers, and share of participants who believe AI applications will aid global education (by likelihood). © 2018 by the Contemporary Science Association, New York.",Algorithmic decision-making; Big data learning analytics; Digital education,
Towards a smart learning environment for smart city governance,"Educational services provided to various stakeholders need to be actively developed to accommodate the diversity of learning models and to get the advantages of available resources (e.g. data) in smart cities governance. Despite the substantial literature on smart cities, for Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) and its related domains such as learning analytics and big data, little effort has been given to the creation of connectivity to smart cities governance to meet stakeholders' demands, even though this connection may generate various challenges arising from conflict of interests between stakeholders and organisations. This paper proposes a structural framework for successful application of smart learning environments in the context of smart city governance. It reflects on selected challenges and proposes some future directions.

An initial study of predictive machine learning analytics on large volumes of historical data for power system applications,"Nowadays large volumes of industrial data are being actively generated and collected in various power system applications. Industrial Analytics in the power system field requires more powerful and intelligent machine learning tools, strategies, and environments to properly analyze the historical data and extract predictive knowledge. This paper discusses the situation and limitations of current approaches, analytic models, and tools utilized to conduct predictive machine learning analytics for very large volumes of data where the data processing causes the processor to run out of memory. Two industrial analytics cases in the power systems field are presented.

Towards a big data architecture for facilitating cyber threat intelligence,"Internet and organizational network security is still threatened by devastating malicious activities. Given the continuous escalation of such attacks in terms of their frequency, sophistication and stealthiness, it is of paramount importance to generate effective cyber threat intelligence that aim at inferring, attributing, characterizing and mitigating such misdemeanors. Nevertheless, such imperative tasks are partially impeded by the lack of approaches that can produce prompt and accurate actionable intelligence by investigating various network traffic sources. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a big data architecture that is rooted in real-time network traffic processing, distributed messaging and scalable data storage. The key innovation behind the proposed architecture is that it automates the analysis of heterogeneous network data, allowing the focus to remain on devising effective cyber threat intelligence analytics, rather than being hindered by data management, aggregation, reconciliation and formatting. Empirical evaluations investigating the application of machine learning analytics by exploiting the artifacts of the proposed architecture and by using 100 GB of real network traffic, indeed demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and added-value of the proposed architecture. © 2016 IEEE.",Big data architecture; Cyber security; Hadoop; Machine learning; Predictive analytics,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Digital storage; Heterogeneous networks; Information management; Learning systems; Network architecture; Predictive analytics; Cyber security; Data architectures; Distributed messaging; Empirical evaluations; Hadoop; Organizational network; Proposed architectures; Scalable data storage; Network security
Applying Educational Data Mining Tools to Learning Management Problems,"During the learning process, more and more data is generated, called big data, which includes a variety of data about students and the learning process. These data represent the 'footprints' that students 'leave' when they interact with an increasingly complex and rapidly changing learning environment. The abundance of data leads to an increasing interest in the use of methods of analytics of educational data (Education Data Mining, EDM) of researchers, teachers and practitioners in the field of academic education. In the process of educational activity, students are constantly faced with an overabundance of information resources. Large amounts of information in a formalized, formalized-algorithmized form lead to an uncontrolled increase in cognitive load in the educational process. In order to manage the learning process, it is necessary in a short time to obtain information about the individual characteristics of the cognitive and mental activity of students in order to reconfigure the educational content, adapt the process to a particular student to reduce the negative effect. In this report, the application of EDM technology in training systems and their prospects is discusses. © 2019 IEEE.",cognitive potential; data analysis methods; DataSet; individual characteristics; integrated environment; learning process,Computer aided instruction; Data mining; Learning systems; cognitive potential; Data analysis methods; DataSet; Individual characteristics; Integrated environment; Learning process; Students
Tracking student performance in introductory programming by means of machine learning,"large amount of digital data is being generated across a wide variety of fields and Data Mining (DM) techniques are used transform it into useful information so as to identify hidden patterns. One of the key areas of the application of Education Data Mining (EDM) is the development of student performance prediction models that would predict the student's performance in educational institutions. We build a model which can notify students (in introductory programming course) about their probable outcomes at an early stage of the semester (when evaluated for 15% grades). We applied 11 Machine Learning algorithms (from 5 categories) over a data source using WEKA and concluded that Decision Tree (J48) is giving higher accuracy in terms of correctly identified instances, F-Measure rate and true positive detections. This study will help to the students to identify their probable final grades and modify their academic behavior accordingly to achieve higher grades. © 2019 IEEE.",Decision tree; Educational data mining; Machine learning; Weka,Big data; Decision trees; Education computing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Smart city; Students; Trees (mathematics); Educational data mining; Educational institutions; Hidden patterns; Introductory programming; Introductory programming course; Student performance; Student's performance; Weka; Data mining
A New Data Mining Model Adopted for Higher Institutions,"In the current times, one of the biggest challenges that educational institutions face in both the developing and developed nations is the explosive growth of educational data and to use this data to improve the quality of managerial decisions. Data mining techniques are considered as an analytical tool can be used to extract meaningful knowledge from these large data sets. The quality of higher education institutions implies providing the services, which most likely meet the needs of students, academic staff, and other participants in the education system.

Towards a data archiving solution for learning analytics,"Data solutions in the teaching and learning space are in need of pro-active innovations in data management, to ensure that systems for learning analytics can scale up to match the size of datasets now available. Here, we illustrate the scale at which a Learning Management System (LMS) accumulates data, and discuss the barriers to using this data for in-depth analyses. We illustrate the exponential growth of our LMS data to represent a single example dataset, and highlight the broader need for taking a pro-active approach to dimensional modelling in learning analytics, anticipating that common learning analytics questions will be computationally expensive, and that the most useful data structures for learning analytics will not necessarily follow those of the source dataset. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Barriers to adoption; Big data; Data retention; Dimensional modelling; Learning analytics; Learning management systems,Big data; Barriers to adoption; Data retention; Exponential growth; In-depth analysis; Learning analytics; Learning management system; Pro-active approach; Teaching and learning; Information management
How will the Internet of Things and big data analytics impact the education of learning-disabled students? A Concept Paper,"In the last decade, the increasing plurality of materials, media types and software tools within the internet has established first steps towards more individualized learning approaches. However, the development of utilizing Big Data-based algorithms of the next internet generation, the so-called 'Internet of Things', leads to a comprehensive approach of personalized learning for very different target groups. Understanding the learner's profile and interests, learning goals and learning difficulties, 'intelligent agents' accompany and guide the learner during the learning process in the future. In particular, for students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia and dyscalculia, the new development of 'learning analytics' based on Big Data algorithms has a large potential. The goal is to overcome the severe gap between their existing intellectual potentials and their often unsuccessful learning biographies in schools and universities. The changes of daily environments towards a 4.0-Society, in particular through fully networked Smart Cities, result in an increasing number of data from very heterogeneous sources. Due to technologies such as, e.g., smart wearables combined with data generated through traffic and mobility or logistics, smart geographical places will be enabled to act as a basis for intelligent learning and evaluation mechanisms. © 2016 IEEE.",(virtual) learning; Big Data Analytics; dyslexia/dyscalculia; individualized teaching; Internet of Things; personalized learning; Smart City technology; smart education; social and economic impacts,Economic and social effects; Education; Engineering education; Intelligent agents; Internet; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Students; Teaching; Wearable technology; (virtual) learning; Data analytics; dyslexia/dyscalculia; Personalized learning; Smart cities; Social and economic impacts; Big data
Future Educational Technology with Big Data and Learning Analytics,"In the recent years, big data and learning analytics have been emerging as fast-growing research fields. The application of these emerging research areas is gradually addressing the contemporary challenges of school and university education. Tracing out the information regarding students' misconceptions and dropping-out probabilities from the courses at the right instant of time, development of detectors of a range of educational importance and achieving the highest level of quality in the higher education are becoming more challenging. Moreover, providing well timed and the best suitable solutions to the students at-risk are even more strenuous. In this concept paper, we aim to address these contemporary challenges of school and the university education and their probable solutions by utilizing our research experiences of automated assessment, immediate feedback, learning analytics and the IT technologies. Solving such problems by knowing the history of students' activities, submissions, and the performances data is possible. The identification of students' misconceptions during the learning process, examining behavioral patterns and significant trends by efficiently aggregating and correlating the massive data, improving the state-of-the-art skills in creative thinking and innovation, and detecting the drop-outs on-time are highlighted in this article. We are aiming at extracting such knowledge so that adaptive and personalized learning will become a part of the current education system. Not only the available algorithm of supervised learning methods such as support vector machine, neural network, decision trees, discriminant analysis, and nearest neighborhood method but also new engineering and distillation of relevant data features can be carried out to solve these educational challenges. © 2018 IEEE.",Big Data; Digital Social Research; Educational Technology; Learning Analytics,Big data; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Distillation; Educational technology; Industrial electronics; Learning systems; Trees (mathematics); Automated assessment; Creative thinking and innovations; Educational challenge; Learning analytics; Nearest neighborhood; Personalized learning; Social research; Supervised learning methods; Students
Predicting students’ academic performance by using educational big data and learning analytics: evaluation of classification methods and learning logs,"In order to enhance the experience of learning, many educators applied learning analytics in a classroom, the major principle of learning analytics is targeting at-risk student and given timely intervention according to the results of student behavior analysis. However, when researchers applied machine learning to train a risk identifying model, the reason which affected the performance of the model was overlooked. This study collected seven datasets within three universities located in Taiwan and Japan and listed performance metrics of risk identification model after fed data into eight classification methods. U1, U2, and U3 were used to denote the three universities, which have three, two, and two cases of datasets (learning logs), respectively. According to the results of this study, the factors influencing the predictive performance of classification methods are the number of significant features, the number of categories of significant features, and Spearman correlation coefficient values. In U1 dataset case 1.3 and U2 dataset case 2.2, the numbers of significant features, numbers of categories of significant features, and Spearman correlation coefficient values for significant features were all relatively high, which is the main reason why these datasets were able to perform classification with high predictive ability. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",academic performance; classification methods; Educational big data; learning analytics; learning logs,
A big data and learning analytics approach to process-level feedback in cognitive simulations,"Collecting and analyzing large amounts of process data for the purposes of education can be considered a big data/learning analytics (BD/LA) approach to improving learning. However, in the education of health care professionals, the application of BD/LA is limited to date. The authors discuss the potential advantages of the BD/LA approach for the process of learning via cognitive simulations. Using the lens of a cognitive model of radiograph interpretation with four phases (orientation, searching/scanning, feature detection, and decision making), they reanalyzed process data from a cognitive simulation of pediatric ankle radiography where 46 practitioners from three expertise levels classified 234 cases online. To illustrate the big data component, they highlight the data available in a digital environment (time-stamped, click-level process data). Learning analytics were illustrated using algorithmic computer-enabled approaches to process-level feedback. For each phase, the authors were able to identify examples of potentially useful BD/LA measures. For orientation, the trackable behavior of re-reviewing the clinical history was associated with increased diagnostic accuracy. For searching/scanning, evidence of skipping views was associated with an increased false-negative rate. For feature detection, heat maps overlaid on the radiograph can provide a metacognitive visualization of common novice errors. For decision making, the measured influence of sequence effects can reflect susceptibility to bias, whereas computer-generated path maps can provide insights into learners' diagnostic strategies. In conclusion, the augmented collection and dynamic analysis of learning process data within a cognitive simulation can improve feedback and prompt more precise reflection on a novice clinician's skill development. © 2016 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",,"ankle; child; cognition; diagnostic imaging; female; human; infant; information processing; learning; male; medical research; preschool child; procedures; radiography; Ankle; Biomedical Research; Child; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Data Collection; Female; Humans; Infant; Learning; Male; Radiography"

Student privacy in learning analytics: An information ethics perspective,"Higher education institutions have started using big data analytics tools. By gathering information about students as they navigate information systems, learning analytics employs techniques to understand student behaviors and to improve instructional, curricular, and support resources and learning environments. However, learning analytics presents important moral and policy issues surrounding student privacy. We argue that there are five crucial questions about student privacy that we must address in order to ensure that whatever the laudable goals and gains of learning analytics, they are commensurate with respecting students' privacy and associated rights, including (but not limited to) autonomy interests. We address information access concerns, the intrusive nature of information-gathering practices, whether or not learning analytics is justified given the potential distribution of consequences and benefits, and issues related to student autonomy. Finally, we question whether learning analytics advances the aims of higher education or runs counter to those goals. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.",Autonomy; higher education; information ethics; information privacy; learning analytics; student privacy,
Learning analytics: Envisioning a research discipline and a domain of practice,"Learning analytics are rapidly being implemented in different educational settings, often without the guidance of a research base.

Researchers, in contrast, have built up a substantial base of techniques for analyzing discourse, social networks, sentiments, predictive models, and in semantic content (i.e., ""intelligent"" curriculum). In spite of the currently limited knowledge exchange and dialogue between researchers, vendors, and practitioners, existing learning analytics implementations indicate significant potential for generating novel insight into learning and vital educational practices.

Analytics in online and offline language learning environments: the role of learning design to understand student online engagement,"Language education has a rich history of research and scholarship focusing on the effectiveness of learning activities and the impact these have on student behaviour and outcomes. One of the basic assumptions in foreign language pedagogy and CALL in particular is that learners want to be able to communicate effectively with native speakers of their chosen language. Combining principles of learning analytics and Big Data with learning design, this study used a student activity based taxonomy adopted by the Open University UK to inform module design. The learning designs of four introductory and intermediary language education modules and online engagement of 2111 learners were contrasted using weekly learning design data. In this study, we aimed to explore how learning design decisions made by language teachers influenced students’ engagement in the VLE. Using fixed effect models, our findings indicated that 55% of variance of weekly online engagement in these four modules was explained by the way language teachers designed weekly learning design activities.

Efficient computation of key performance indicators in a distance learning university,"Purpose: Managing efficiently educational Big Data, produced by Virtual Learning Environments, is becoming a compelling necessity, especially for those universities providing distance learning. This paper aims to propose a possible framework to compute efficiently key performance indicators, summarizing the trends of students’ academic careers, by using educational Big Data. Design/methodology/approach: The framework is designed and implemented in a distributed fashion. The parallel computation of the indicators through Map and Reduce nodes is carefully described, together with the workflow of data, from the educational sources to a NoSQL database and to the learning analytics engine. Findings: This framework was tested at eCampus University, an Italian distance learning institution, and it was able to significantly reduce the amount of time needed to compute key performance indicators. Moreover, by implementing a proper data representation dashboard, it resulted in a useful help and support for educational decisions and performance analyses and for revealing possible criticalities. Originality/value: The framework proposed integrates for the first time, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, a set of modules, designed and implemented in a distributed fashion, to compute key performance indicators for distance learning institutions. It can be used to analyze the dropouts and the outcomes of students and, therefore, to evaluate the performances of universities, which can, in turn, propose effective improvements toward enhancing the overall e-learning scenario. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",E-Learning; Educational big data; Key performance indicators; Learning analytics; MapReduce; Virtual learning environment,
Ethical considerations in the practical application of the unisa socio-critical model of student success,"The prediction and classification of student performance has always been a central concern within higher education institutions. It is therefore natural for higher education institutions to harvest and analyse student data to inform decisions on education provision in resource constrained South African environments. One of the drivers for the use of learning and academic analytics is the pressures for greater accountability in the areas of improved learning outcomes and student success. Added to this is the pressure on local government to produce well-educated populace to participate in the economy. The counter discourse in the field of big data cautions against algocracy where algorithms takeover the human process of democratic decision making. Proponents of this view argue that we run the risk of creating institutions that are beholden to algorithms predicting student success but are unsure of how they work and are too afraid to ignore their guidance. This paper aims to discuss the ethics, values, and moral arguments revolving the use of big data using a practical demonstration of learning analytics applied at Unisa.",Academic analytics; Algocracy; Higher education; Learning analytics,

Are We on Our Way to Becoming a “Helicopter University”? Academics’ Views on Learning Analytics,"Higher education institutions are developing the capacity for learning analytics. However, the technical development of learning analytics has far exceeded the consideration of ethical issues around learning analytics. We examined higher education academics’ knowledge, attitudes, and concerns about the use of learning analytics though four focus groups (N = 35). Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts identified five key themes. The first theme, ‘Facilitating learning’, represents academics’ perceptions that, while currently unrealized, there could be several benefits to learning analytics that would help their students. Three themes; ‘Where are the ethics?’, ‘What about the students!’, and ‘What about me!’ represented academics’ perceptions of how learning analytics could pose some considerable difficulties within a higher education context. A final theme ‘Let’s move forward together’ reflected that despite some challenges and concerns about learning analytics, academics perceived scope for learning analytics to be beneficial if there is collaboration between academics, students, and the university. The findings highlight the need to include academics in the development of learning analytics policies and procedures to promote the suitability and widespread adoption of learning analytics in the higher education sector. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Academic attitudes; Big data; Higher education; Learning analytics,Big data; Philosophical aspects; Students; Academic attitudes; Ethical issues; Focus groups; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Learning analytics; Technical development; Thematic analysis; Education
Big(ger) data as better data in open distance learning,"In the context of the hype, promise and perils of Big Data and the currently dominant paradigm of data-driven decision-making, it is important to critically engage with the potential of Big Data for higher education. We do not question the potential of Big Data, but we do raise a number of issues, and present a number of theses to be seriously considered in realising this potential. The University of South Africa (Unisa) is one of the mega ODL institutions in the world with more than 360,000 students and a range of courses and programmes. Unisa already has access to a staggering amount of student data, hosted in disparate sources, and governed by different processes. As the university moves to mainstreaming online learning, the amount of and need for analyses of data are increasing, raising important questions regarding our assumptions, understanding, data sources, systems and processes. This article presents a descriptive case study of the current state of student data at Unisa, as well as explores the impact of existing data sources and analytic approaches. From the analysis it is clear that in order for big(ger) data to be better data, a number of issues need to be addressed.

Applying Learning Analytics to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning,"In this article we report on the findings of a project funded by the Australian Office for Learning and Teaching and entitled “Learning Analytics: Assisting Universities with Student Retention.” While this project was primarily focused on retention as a potential outcome of learning analytics, its application could be related to the broader concept of student success. Student success allows for a focus on pedagogy and the use of learning analytics for the improvement of learning and teaching with a firm scholarly evidence base.

Understanding learning analytics from an IT affordance perspective,"Learning analytics offers the possibilities for higher education institutions (HEIs) to unlock the value of educational big data to help make better learning decisions. While it has recently attracted increasing interest, HEIs have made limited use of the available data and more research is yet to be conducted to build the theoretical and empirical base. This study draws on IT affordance theory to develop an exploratory conceptual framework to understand how the action possibilities afforded by learning analytics to HEI users for decision-making can be actualized. The framework is tested using a qualitative research method based on interviews and case studies. This study mainly contributes to the literature by building an exploratory theory and early theory testing about learning analytics affordances in the HEI context. It has the potential to help HEIs better realize the action possibilities afforded by learning analytics to HEI users thereby to improve learning related decision-making. © PACIS 2017.",Affordance; Conceptual framework; Learning analytics; Learning analytics affordance,Decision making; Information systems; Information use; Affordance theories; Affordances; Case-studies; Conceptual frameworks; Higher education institutions (HEIs); Qualitative research methods; Theory testing; Decision theory
Challenges of big data in educational assessment,"This paper briefly discusses four measurement challenges of data science or 'big data' in educational assessments that are enabled by technology: 1. Dealing with change over time via time-based data. 2. How a digital performance space's relationships interact with learner actions, communications and products. 3. How layers of interpretation are formed from translations of atomistic data into meaningful larger units suitable for making inferences about what someone knows and can do. 4. How to represent the dynamics of interactions between and among learners who are being assessed by their interactions with each other as well as with digital resources and agents in digital performance spaces. Because of the movement from paper-based tests to online learning, and in order to make progress on these challenges, the authors advocate the restructuring of training of the next generation of researchers and psychometricians to specialize in data science in technology enabled assessments. This call to action stemmed from discussions at EDUsummIT 2013, which will be published in depth in a special issue of Education and Information Technologies.",Big data; Data science in educational assessment; Educational measurement; Learning analytics; New psychometrics,Cognitive systems; E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Digital resources; Educational assessment; Educational measurement; Learning analytics; New psychometrics; Online learning; Paper-based test; Performance spaces; Big data

In the future, this research could be useful as a case study of using learning analytics and hopefully learning analysis tools will be used more widely in education and that this research can be extended into more fields.",Big data; General mathematics; Learning analytics; Mathematics education,
Analyzing the log patterns of adult learners in LMS using learning analytics,"In this paper, we describe a process of constructing proxy variables that represent adult learners' time management strategies in an online course. Based upon previous research, three values were selected from a data set. According to the result of empirical validation, an (ir)regularity of the learning interval was proven to be correlative with and predict learning performance. As indicated in previous research, regularity of learning is a strong indicator to explain learners' consistent endeavors. This study demonstrates the possibility of using learning analytics to address a learner's specific competence on the basis of a theoretical background. Implications for the learning analytics field seeking a pedagogical theory-driven approach are discussed.

Implementation of learning analytics framework for MOOCs using state-of-The-Art in-memory computing,"MOOC aims at delivering online courses to tens of thousands to millions of heterogeneous learners at the same time, with minimal or no charge. It provides an alternate way to disseminate quality education to the section of people who cannot reach premier institutions. It has great potential to overcome the barriers of traditional learning systems. However, there are several challenges in MOOCs such as huge drop-out rates, improper automated assessments, varied student engagement, and attention etc. Learning Analytics helps us to contain such issues. Learning analytics, with the help of Big Data Technologies, helps us to interpret humongous MOOCs data to assess progress, predict performance and identify problems. To perform analytics, we developed a workflow using Apache Spark, a scalable inmemory computing framework. The data from edX platform has been used for experiments. It contains the information of more than 2 Lakh students from 39 courses. Initially, detailed statistical analysis has been carried out to understand the learning patterns and the behavior of online learners. Later, we have developed drop-out prediction models using various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Logistic Regression. A stacked ensemble model is developed and performance comparison with baseline models is carried out. It outperformed all other models with an accuracy of 91.2%. © 2017 IEEE.",Apache Spark; Drop-out Prediction; Gradient Boosting; Learning Analytics; Logistic Regression; MOOCs; Random Forest; Stacked Ensemble,Big data; Decision trees; Drops; E-learning; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Drop-out; Gradient boosting; Learning Analytics; Logistic regressions; MOOCs; Random forests; Stacked Ensemble; Education
Review of eQETIC model based on academic analytics,"The avalanche of data of many types generated at high speed proposes nowadays a new scenario nominated Big Data. These data generated by many types of systems, such as commercial systems, financial systems, and even systems involving areas such as healthcare and education need to be analyzed to favor decision making. In this sense, specific techniques and technologies can be used together to establish Analytics, a special term used for data analysis. Generally called Analytics, specifications such as Business Analytics, Learning Analytics, or Academic Analytics can be identified. In this way, this research addresses the relationship between the concepts of Academic Analytics and a specific model for the management and operation of digital solutions in the educational area called eQETIC. Analyzing the practices proposed by the model and the concepts, it is possible to identify, in a non-quantitative way, that the model favors the activities of data management and data analysis; consequently it is also favor the implementation of Academic Analytics. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Academic Analytics; Digital Educational Solutions; Distance Education,Data handling; Decision making; Distance education; Information analysis; Information management; Academic Analytics; Business analytics; Commercial systems; Digital solutions; Educational area; Financial system; Learning analytics; Model-based OPC; Big data
Bayesian network for predicting students' final grade using e-book logs in university education,"This paper describes visualization and analysis methods using educational big data collected by research project at Kyushu University in Japan. The project uses an e-book system called BookLooper, Moodle, and Mahara. Logs for this analytics were collected from 99 first-year students in an information science course at Kyushu University. The number of logs are collected approximately 330,000, and this paper visualize and analyze the collected logs. The purpose of this study is to predict students' final grade and to profile visualization and analysis results. The prediction of this study shows that it leads to discoveries of students who fail to make the grade. © 2016 IEEE.",Association analysis; E-book; Learning analytics; Social network analysis,Bayesian networks; Big data; Data visualization; Education; Electronic publishing; Engineering education; Forecasting; Social networking (online); Visualization; Association analysis; E-books; First year students; Learning analytics; University education; Visualization and analysis; Students
The Structural Consequences of Big Data-Driven Education,"Educators and commenters who evaluate big data-driven learning environments focus on specific questions: whether automated education platforms improve learning outcomes, invade student privacy, and promote equality. This article puts aside separate unresolved - and perhaps unresolvable - issues regarding the concrete effects of specific technologies. It instead examines how big data-driven tools alter the structure of schools' pedagogical decision-making, and, in doing so, change fundamental aspects of America's education enterprise. Technological mediation and data-driven decision-making have a particularly significant impact in learning environments because the education process primarily consists of dynamic information exchange. In this overview, I highlight three significant structural shifts that accompany school reliance on data-driven instructional platforms that perform core school functions: teaching, assessment, and credentialing. First, virtual learning environments create information technology infrastructures featuring constant data collection, continuous algorithmic assessment, and possibly infinite record retention. This undermines the traditional intellectual privacy and safety of classrooms. Second, these systems displace pedagogical decision-making from educators serving public interests to private, often for-profit, technology providers. They constrain teachers' academic autonomy, obscure student evaluation, and reduce parents' and students' ability to participate or challenge education decision-making. Third, big data-driven tools define what ""counts"" as education by mapping the concepts, creating the content, determining the metrics, and setting desired learning outcomes of instruction. These shifts cede important decision-making to private entities without public scrutiny or pedagogical examination. In contrast to the public and heated debates that accompany textbook choices, schools often adopt education technologies ad hoc. Given education's crucial impact on individual and collective success, educators and policymakers must consider the implications of data-driven education proactively and explicitly. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.",big data; competency-based education; learning analytics; MOOCs; personalized learning; smart tutors,"decision making; education; human; learning; statistical analysis; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Decision Making; Education; Humans; Learning"
Taiwan digital learning initiative and big data analytics in education cloud,"Taiwan's Ministry of Education (MoE) started planning and promoting comprehensive Digital Learning Initiative in 2013. It is expected that teachers and students can use broadband networks in campus in 2017. Students can do online learning with different kinds of digital devices at any time. Besides, students can do ubiquitous learning by getting digital learning resources on cloud devices. Teachers can grasp innovative teaching strategies with the application of digital technology and design the learning activities that are more adaptive to individual students. Students have the information force of mobile learning, the abilities to use information tools and grasp the information, as well as Internet literacy and ethics. The learning model of education at all levels will transform into student-centered to facilitate justice, public, autonomy and adaptive learning opportunities as well as make students in the country and those in the city have equal digital learning opportunities. Digital Learning Initiative will have profound influence on education system. Education cloud (EduCloud) is the flagship of the digital learning initiative. This paper presents our research and experience of applying Big data analytics to the EduCloud. We address Big data infrastructure and analytics to cover the issues of data collection, cleaning, storage, query, analytics, and visualization in order to make EduCloud more suitable for teachers and students in Taiwan. © 2016 IEEE.",Big data; Digital learning; Education cloud; Learning analytics,Big data; Broadband networks; Data visualization; Digital devices; Digital storage; Education; Education computing; Information science; Students; Teaching; Digital learning resources; Digital technologies; Digital-learning; Innovative teaching; Internet literacies; Learning analytics; Ministry of Education; Ubiquitous learning; E-learning
Towards an open architecture for learning analytics in open and distance education,"A characteristic of open and distance education is that all transactions between the learner and the university leave a digital footprint. This data trail gives open universities a golden opportunity to be in the forefront developing solutions for learning analytics and utilizating of educational big data. This paper explores development of an open architecture for learning analytics, from clarifying the concept of openness in the context of analytics to suggesting specific components a technical architecture for open and distance education. A literature review of the concept of openness in relation to learning analytics identifies a need for conceptual clarification, in particular in the context of open and distance education. The paper applies two conceptual frameworks to support the development of requirements for an open architecture, the European interoperability framework, and the ISO/IEC reference model for learning analytics. Components of an open architecture defined at Shanghai Open University are presented, and a process for validation of this architecture is suggested. © 2018 Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education..All Rights Reserved.",Distance education; Open; Open learning analytics; Open learning analytics architecture; Open platform,Computer architecture; Conceptual frameworks; Developing solutions; Interoperability framework; Literature reviews; Open; Open learning; Open platforms; Technical architecture; Distance education
Big learning data analytics support for engineering career readiness,"21st Century education develops professional competencies such as lifelong learning, critical thinking and creativity. Learning analytics (LA) and Big Data approaches are emerging to discover readiness patterns of higher education learners towards embracing these competences. To supplement formal education into building these career-oriented habits, a portal application is proposed by feeding data streams gathered from learners throughout their higher-education lifetime, into an analytics engine that reveals levels of professional competencies achievement and tells learners how to increase their career readiness. Big Data techniques are used to gather and cluster data streams, whereas LA techniques examine these data to derive levels of career readiness, which guide higher education learners into a successful career path. The proposed methodology starts by defining and validating standard career disposition criteria inspired from education psychology literature. These intangible disposition indicators and other career-oriented data are stored in a data warehouse for further aggregation and analysis, to evaluate similarities among career patterns and to cluster individuals whose career prospects are deemed similar, into a community of practice (CoP). We synthesize this novel online social structure as a result of the proposed portal processes to augment formal education with a virtual learning environment. This informal classroom-like structure is supervised by a professional mentor to bridge diverse viewpoints and instill a joint effort to leverage future workforce developments. CoP also provides indicators and means to intervene in order to positively affect career readiness. © 2014 IEEE.",Big Data; career readiness; community of practice; Learning analytics,Big data; Coefficient of performance; Computer aided instruction; Data Analytics; Data warehouses; E-learning; career readiness; Community of practice; Engineering careers; Learning analytics; Life long learning; Professional competencies; Virtual learning environments; Workforce development; Professional aspects
Application of Machine Learning and Big data Analytics in Pharmacovigilance and Drug Safety,"Machine learning technique is revolutionizing in all stages of drug discovery and developments starting from drug design, pivotal clinical trials to clinical practice. Application of machine learning techniques and big data analytics for looking upon the unintended effects of new or commonly prescribed medicines would enhance new technical approaches to generate and test 'signals' related to drug safety. It would craft as a path finder for pharmacovigilance resources, time, and skills for transforming the efforts from a volume-based focus to a value-based focus. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the current scenario of pharmacovigilance programme, the importance of real world data, and machine learning analytics in the conduct of pharmacovigilance for better reproducibility and reliability. Precise and in-depth evaluation and prediction of drug safety database using machine learning techniques were also discussed in this paper. The utilization of these techniques in pharmacovigilance programme will improve its accuracy and reproducibility, and will boost this drug safety surveillance system's role as a pillar in patient safety. © 2019 IEEE.",big data; drug safety; machine learning; pharmacovigilance; predictive analytics,Big data; Controlled drug delivery; Data Analytics; Intelligent computing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Clinical practices; Depth evaluations; Drug safety; Machine learning techniques; Patient safety; Pharmacovigilance; Reproducibilities; Surveillance systems; Drug products
Digital analytics in professional work and learning,"ABSTRACT: In a wide range of fields, professional practice is being transformed by the increasing influence of digital analytics: the massive volumes of big data, and software algorithms that are collecting, comparing and calculating that data to make predictions and even decisions. Researchers in a number of social sciences have been calling attention to the far-reaching and accelerating consequences of these forces, claiming that many professionals, researchers, policy-makers and the public are just beginning to realise the enormous potentials and challenges these analytics are producing. Yet, outside of particular areas of research and practice, such as learning analytics, there has been little discussion of this to date in the broader education literature. This article aims to set out some key issues particularly relevant to the understandings of professional practice, knowledge and learning posed by the linkages of big data and software code. It begins by outlining definitions, forms and examples of these analytics, their potentialities and some of the hidden impact, and then presents issues for researchers and educators. It seeks to contribute to and extend debates taking place in certain quarters to a broader professional education and work audience. © 2015 The Author(s).

ARCS-assisted teaching robots based on anticipatory computing and emotional Big Data for improving sustainable learning efficiency and motivation,"Under the vigorous development of global anticipatory computing in recent years, there have been numerous applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in people's daily lives. Learning analytics of big data can assist students, teachers, and school administrators to gain new knowledge and estimate learning information; in turn, the enhanced education contributes to the rapid development of science and technology. Education is sustainable life learning, as well as the most important promoter of science and technology worldwide. In recent years, a large number of anticipatory computing applications based on AI have promoted the training professional AI talent. As a result, this study aims to design a set of interactive robot-assisted teaching for classroom setting to help students overcoming academic difficulties. Teachers, students, and robots in the classroom can interact with each other through the ARCS motivation model in programming. The proposed method can help students to develop the motivation, relevance, and confidence in learning, thus enhancing their learning effectiveness. The robot, like a teaching assistant, can help students solving problems in the classroom by answering questions and evaluating students' answers in natural and responsive interactions. The natural interactive responses of the robot are achieved through the use of a database of emotional big data (Google facial expression comparison dataset). The robot is loaded with an emotion recognition system to assess the moods of the students through their expressions and sounds, and then offer corresponding emotional responses. The robot is able to communicate naturally with the students, thereby attracting their attention, triggering their learning motivation, and improving their learning effectiveness. © 2020 by the authors.",Anticipatory computing; ARCS model; Artificial intelligence; Emotional big data; Robot-assisted teaching; Sustainable learning,
Advancement and research trends of smart learning environments in the mobile era,"Currently, the rapid development of modern technologies has been influencing and changing every aspect of our society, in an attempt to make our lives more convenient and intelligent. Constructing and applying Smart Learning Environments (SLEs) is such an effort to offer learners personalised learning experiences both effectively and efficiently. In the past half century, a steady development in the literature on SLEs has been identified. Moreover, most studies have been conducted in the fields of computer science, engineering, mathematics and social science. In the meantime, several technological components of SLEs have been identified as follows: overall, dynamic and open models of learners, mobile technologies and innovative technologies, intelligent cloud service, educational big data and learning analytics. Some salient pedagogical affordances of SLEs have also been presented, such as personalised learning content and paths, cognitive guiding, developing highorder abilities, facilitating diverse learning modes, and fostering autonomous learning and lifelong learning abilities. Finally, several future developmental trends or suggestions are proposed, such as taking learners' self-assessments into consideration when making decisions on personalised guiding, investigating the implementation of strategies and the application effects of the mixed learning modes based on SLEs in different teaching contexts, and so on. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Educational big data; Learning analytics; Mobile learning; Smart learning environments; Trend analysis,
Connecting learning analytics with learning research: the role of design-based research,"This paper argues that learning analytics (LA) can make contributions to learning research, in addition to aiming for improvements in learning and teaching practices in a solely applied sense. Indeed, there is potential for transforming learning research if certain approaches developed in LA were used more extensively to study learning. The potential to advance learning research is explored along four dimensions: (1) data quantity, (2) longitudinal data, (3) data from multiple levels, and (4) data from multiple locations. This is followed by a description of how design-based research as practised in the learning sciences can serve as a bridge to LA, and how it would transform LA into a methodology that is also useful for advancing theories and models of learning. © 2016, © 2016 The Author(s).

Combining event- and variable-centred approaches to institution-facing learning analytics at the unit of study level,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of combining event-centred and variable-centred approaches when analysing big data for higher education institutions. It uses a large, university-wide data set to demonstrate the methodology for this analysis by using the case study method. It presents empirical findings about relationships between student behaviours in a learning management system (LMS) and the learning outcomes of students, and further explores these findings using process modelling techniques. Design/methodology/approach: The paper describes a two-year study in a Chilean university, using big data from a LMS and from the central university database of student results and demographics. Descriptive statistics of LMS use in different years presents an overall picture of student use of the system. Process mining is described as an event-centred approach to give a deeper level of understanding of these findings. Findings: The study found evidence to support the idea that instructors do not strongly influence student use of an LMS. It replicates existing studies to show that higher-performing students use an LMS differently from the lower-performing students. It shows the value of combining variable- and event-centred approaches to learning analytics. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by its institutional context, its two-year time frame and by its exploratory mode of investigation to create a case study. Practical implications: The paper is useful for institutions in developing a methodology for using big data from a LMS to make use of event-centred approaches. Originality/value: The paper is valuable in replicating and extending recent studies using event-centred approaches to analysis of learning data. The study here is on a larger scale than the existing studies (using a university-wide data set), in a novel context (Latin America), that provides a clear description for how and why the methodology should inform institutional approaches. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Data; e-Learning; Educational administrative data processing; Latin America; Learning analytics; Universities,
Analysis of student behavior in learning management systems through a Big Data framework,"In recent years, learning management systems (LMSs) have played a fundamental role in higher education teaching models. A new line of research has been opened relating to the analysis of student behavior within an LMS, in the search for patterns that improve the learning process. Current e-learning platforms allow for recording student activity, thereby enabling the exploration of events generated in the use of LMS tools. This paper presents a case study conducted at the Catholic University of Murcia, where student behavior in the past four academic years was analyzed according to learning modality (that is, on-campus, online, and blended), considering the number of accesses to the LMS, tools employed by students and their associated events. Given the difficulty of managing the large volume of data generated by users in the LMS (up to 70 GB in this study), statistical and association rule techniques were performed using a Big Data framework, thus speeding up the statistical analysis of the data. The obtained results are demonstrated using visual analytic techniques, and evaluated in order to detect trends and deficiencies in the use of the LMS by students. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Apriori algorithm; Big data; E-learning analytics; Learning management systems; MapReduce; Student behavior,E-learning; Education computing; Information management; Students; Analytic technique; Apriori algorithms; E-learning platforms; Learning management system; Learning modalities; Learning process; Map-reduce; Student behavior; Big data

Millipede: Die-stacked memory optimizations for big data machine learning analytics,"The technology-push of die stacking and application pull of Big Data machine learning analytics (BMLA) have created a unique opportunity for processing-near-memory (PNM). This paper makes four contributions: (1) While previous PNM work explores general MapReduce workloads, we identify three application characteristics of most BMLAs: (a) irregular-And-compute-light (i.e., perform only a few operations per input word which include data-dependent branches and indirect memory accesses); (b) compact (i.e., the relevant portion of the input data and the intermediate live data for each thread are small); and (c) memory-row-dense (i.e., process the input data without skipping over many bytes). These characteristics, except for irregularity, are necessary for bandwidth-And energy-efficient PNM, irrespective of the architecture. (2) Based on these characteristics, we propose memory optimizations for a 'sea of simple MIMD cores (SSMC)' PNM architecture, called Millipede, which (pre) fetches and operates on entire memory rows to exploit BMLAs' row-density. Instead of this row-oriented access and compute-schedule, traditional multicores opportunistically improve row locality while fetching and operating on cache blocks. (3) Millipede employs well-known MIMD execution to handle BMLAs' irregularity, and sequential prefetch of input data to hide memory latency. In Millipede, however, one corelet prefetches a row for all the corelets which may stray far from each other due to their MIMD execution. Consequently, a leading corelet may prematurely evict the prefetched data before a lagging corelet has consumed the data. Millipede employs cross-corelet flow-control to prevent such eviction. (4) Millipede further exploits its flow-controlled prefetch for frequency scaling based on coarse-grain compute-memory rate-matching which decreases (increases) the processor clock speed when the prefetch buffers are empty (full). Using simulations, we compare PNM architectures to show that Millipede improves performance and energy, by 135% and 27% over a GPGPU with prefetch, and by 35% and 36% over SSMC with prefetch, when all three PNM architectures use the same resources (i.e., number of cores and on-processor-die memory) and identical die-stacking. © 2018 IEEE.",Big Data; Machine Learning; Processing Near Memory; Row oriented,Artificial intelligence; Dies; Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy efficiency; Input output programs; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Parallel processing systems; Program processors; Big-data machines; Energy efficient; Frequency-scaling; Memory latencies; Memory optimization; Processor clock speed; Row oriented; Technology pushes; Big data
Student-centric learning analytics: Putting analytics into the hands of students,"Learning Analytics is growing rapidly across Higher Education institutions across the globe. There are some software solutions to learning analytics which are mainly focusing on intervention, retention and resource allocation, driving institutions to collect and analyse data at an institutional level. Such data only provides a small window into a student and how they spend their time learning. Institutions link progression to specific interactions and neglect students’ self-study, any social factors and any individual learning needs. Therefore, this paper is looking at Learning Analytics and how data can help each student individually. To achieve this, the data should examine and analyse a student providing intuitive data that can be used to reflect and alter learning behaviour. The proposed solution is more than just contributing to a data-driven education system allowing students to add learning activities, set personal targets and interact with members of staff during sessions; this enhances students self-regulated learning skills and their engagement while providing a clearer picture of a student’s learning behaviour. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

Applying learning analytics for improving students engagement and learning outcomes in an MOOCs enabled collaborative programming course,"As information technology continues to evolve rapidly, programming skills become increasingly crucial. To be able to construct superb programming skills, the training must begin before college or even senior high school. However, when developing comprehensive training programmers, the learning and teaching processes must be considered. In order to improve the students' learning outcome and engagement in programming course, this study applied learning analytics into the proposed massive online open courses (MOOCs) enabled collaborative programming course. Through the proposed learning activity, instructors receive a monthly report that explains which students are at risk and in need of timely intervention. This study conducted an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed learning activity. Students in the experimental group received learning interventions from an instructor according to the result of learning analytics, and students in the control group received interventions according to the instructor's observation. The data for this study were collected over 10 weeks at a university in Taiwan. The result indicated that the proposed programming course with learning analytics improved students' learning outcomes and levels of engagement. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",big data analytics; collaborative programming; Learning analytics; MOOCs; self-regulated learning,
Next-term student grade prediction,"An enduring issue in higher education is student retention to successful graduation. To further this goal, we develop a system for the task of predicting students' course grades for the next enrollment term in a traditional university setting. Each term, students enroll in a limited number of courses and earn grades in the range A-F for each course. Given historical grade data, our task is to predict the grades for each student in the courses they will enroll in during the next term. With this problem formulation, the next-term student grade prediction problem becomes quite similar to a rating prediction or next-basket recommendation problem. The factorization machine (FM), a general-purpose matrix factorization (MF) algorithm suitable for this task, is leveraged as the state-of-the-art method and compared to a variety of other methods. Our experiments show that FMs achieve the lowest prediction error. Results for both cold-start and non-cold-start prediction demonstrate that FMs can be used to accurately predict in both settings. Finally, we identify limitations observed in FMs and the other models tested and discuss directions for future work. To our knowledge, this is the first study that applies state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms to solve the next-term student grade prediction problem. © 2015 IEEE.",cold-start; educational data mining; factorization machines; grade prediction; matrix factorization; recommender system; regression,Collaborative filtering; Data mining; Education; Education computing; Factorization; Forecasting; Matrix algebra; Recommender systems; Students; Cold start; Educational data mining; Factorization machines; Grade predictions; Matrix factorizations; regression; Big data
Integrating Learning Analytics for higher-order thinking e-Assessments,"This paper attempts to understand the broader implications for integrating learning analytics in e-learning systems. This is also the commencement of a collaborative effort for developing research bases around learning analytics between the University of Mauritius and the University of KwaZulu-Natal. The focus on e-Assessments is deliberate: The tendancy in both our universities to appraise student learning as summative and quantitative does not reflect contemporary workplace and scholarly needs where learning processes are more valuable than outcomes. The necessity for epistemological rethinking and developing systems based on contextual requirements is important, whether it is related to curriculum development or workshop organisation or even conducting a class. After a survey of the literature on the potentials and hypes around learning analytics, we look towards the literature linking learning analytics, data mining and e-Assessment for educators to interface more effectively and efficiently with the LMS platform. We conclude this concept-paper with a workshop outline which can help educational technologists organise practical, sustainable and meaningful hands-on sessions with educators. © 2015 IEEE.",Big data; Data mining; E-Assessments; Higher order thinking skills (HOTS); Learning analytics,Curricula; Data mining; Distributed computer systems; E-learning; Education; Contextual requirements; Curriculum development; E assessments; Higher order thinking skills; Higher-order thinkings; Learning analytics; Learning process; Workshop organisations; Big data
Endless horizons? Addressing current concerns about learning analytics,"A few years after the emergence of learning analytics as a relevant topic in educational research, which has been accompanied by several publications devoted to the theme, we still see how the different topics seem to alternate both converging and diverging trends. Thus, whereas sometimes different approaches seem to converge into the study of the same issue or situation, other times the same approaches are applied to solve different problems in a divergent way. This situation becomes more complex with the added inclusion of new technological advances and analysis techniques, as a result of which the extension of the scope of learning analytics as a discipline may be perceived as endless or boundless. This is an introduction to the Track on Learning Analytics within the Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality 2015 Conference, which aims to address some of the current concerns on learning analytics and help clearing the horizon. This introductory paper provides an overview of the rationale of the track's proposal, including different topics open for discussion; the introduction is followed by an insight of the submission management and participants' selection process. Then, a detailed summary of the manuscripts accepted for participation in the conference is presented. © 2015 ACM.",Big Data; Common Frameworks; Decision Making; Ethical Issues; Integration; Learning Analytics; Tiny Data,Decision making; Ecology; Ecosystems; Integration; Analysis techniques; Common Frameworks; Educational research; Ethical issues; Learning Analytics; Technological advances; Tiny Data; Big data
The Current State of Analytics: Implications for Learning Management System (LMS) Use in Writing Pedagogy,"Amid the burgeoning interest in and use of academic and learning analytics through learning management systems (LMS), the implications of big data and their uses should be central to computers and writing scholarship. In this case study we describe the UMN Canvas LMS experience in such as way so that writing instructors might become more familiar with levels of access to academic and learning analytics, more acquainted with the analytical capabilities in LMSs, and more mindful of implications of learning analytics stemming from LMS use in writing pedagogy. We provide a historical account on the development and infusion of LMS in writing pedagogy and demonstrate how these systems are affecting the way computers and composition scholars consider writing instruction and assessment. We then respond critically to the collection of data drawn from the authors’ use of these systems in on-campus and online teaching.

The creation of open datasets can speed up research advancements by allowing researchers to focus efforts on developing and validating analytical techniques, rather than on obtaining data. Open datasets also allow researchers to benchmark new analytical approaches against a known standard, and increase the reproducibility of research. The field of higher education learning analytics could benefit from the creation of open, shared datasets on higher education students as these data do not currently exist in open and accessible formats. Here, we propose the use of synthetic data generators to create open access versions of student data. Synthetic datasets have an advantage over real data, as private student data is protected by federal laws. We compare the characteristics of the synthetic data to the original data and illustrate a model for how the synthetic data can be leveraged for developing and optimizing a common learning analytics algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.",collaborative research; learning analytics; open science,Big data; Education computing; Open Data; Students; Analytical approach; Collaborative research; Higher education; Higher education students; learning analytics; Open science; Reproducibilities; Synthetic datasets; Data Sharing
Invideo—a novel big data analytics tool for video data analytics and its use in enhancing interactions in cybersecurity online education,"Analyzing video data, a major format of unstructured data, is an emerging area in big data analytics evidencing an increasingly prominent trend in current efforts to harness data from and build new environments and cultures of digital learning and many other areas. However, challenges in video data analysis are often not addressed due to their complexity and challenges in penetrating into videos. In this paper, we present a novel system—inVideo for video data analytics, and its use in learning analytics as the field strives toward new cultures of learning in the digital realm involving large quantities of video data in MOOCs.inVideo is able to analyze video content automatically without the need for the initial viewing by human. Using a highly efficient video indexing engine we developed, the system is able to analyze both language and video frames. The index engine works in two ways: it identifies keywords and language patterns in the audio, and identifies objects and individuals in each frame based on reference files, pictures or knowledge. The time-stamped commenting and tagging features make it an effective tool for increasing interactions in online learning and social networking systems.Experiments show that inVideo presents an efficient tool to begin to address the challenge of initial data selection and reduction for analysis that could be used in multiple applied and empirical settings for learning technology research and increase interactions in online learning. With the data we tested, interactions in in online classes increased seven times across 24 classes program-wide. © 2014 WIT Press.",Assessment; Big data; Learning analytics; MOOCs; video index,Assessment; Cyber security; Data analytics; Learning analytics; MOOCs; On-line education; Video data; Video indices; Language patterns; Learning technology; Social networking systems; Video data analysis; Big data; Computational linguistics; Computer graphics; Distance education; E-learning; Engines; Indexing (of information); Online systems; Software testing; Video recording
Developing SMART educational cloud environment on the basis of adaptive massive open online courses,"The use of adaptive massive open online courses (MOOCs) in the educational process of students contributes to the expansion of ways to implement personalized learning. The development of new approaches and intellectual methods for this area is a priority. Based on the developed approaches, it is possible to build individual educational paths in MOOCs. The analysis showed that the development of new intellectual methods for providing complex personalization in the SMART educational cloud environment requires further research and scientific justification. The development of this direction will ensure the implementation of the most important didactic principles: individualization, differentiation and adaptability. In this paper we summarize the approaches and methods used to provide personalization in the MOOC. In our research model of the adaptive MOOC architecture is presented. It includes describing of the following main components: «Database Student», «Database Course», «Database Learning Process», «MOOC Intelligent System», «Personal Learning Path». The interconnection of the processes of these components is based on Big Data processing and analysis, using the methods Data Analysis, Learning Analytics, Education Data Mining. © 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

Strategies for data and learning analytics informed national education policies: The case of Uruguay,"This work provides an overview of an education and technology monitoring system developed at Plan Ceibal, a nationwide initiative created to enable technology enhanced learning in Uruguay. Plan Ceibal currently offers one-to-one access to technology and connectivity to every student and teacher (from primary and secondary education) as well as a comprehensive set of educational software platforms. All these resources generate massive amounts of data about the progress and style of students learning. This work introduces the conceptual framework, design and preliminary results of the Big Data Center for learning analytics currently being developed at Plan Ceibal. This initiative is focused on exploiting these datasets and conducting advanced analytics to support the educational system. To this aim, a 360 degrees profile will be built including information characterizing the user's online behavior as well as a set of technology enhanced learning factors. These profiles will be studied both at user (e.g., student or teacher) and larger scale levels (e.g., per school or school system), addressing both the need of understanding how technology is being used for learning as well as to provide accurate feedback to support evidence based educational policies. © 2017 ACM.",Big data; Education policies; Plan Ceibal; Technology enhanced learning,Behavioral research; Big data; Education; Students; Teaching; Conceptual frameworks; Education policies; Educational software; Educational systems; Plan Ceibal; Primary and secondary education; Technology enhanced learning; Technology monitoring; Engineering education
Performance Evaluation of a MapReduce Hadoop-Based Implementation for Processing Large Virtual Campus Log Files,"Cloud computing technologies are bringing new scales of computational processing power and storage capacity to meet very demanding requirements of today's applications. One such family of applications is the one of analytics based on processing big data. More specifically, there is a large family of analytics applications from processing log data files. Indeed, log data files are commonplace in many Internet-based systems and applications, comprising system logs, server logs, application logs, databases logs, user activity logs, etc. These applications are analytics oriented applications based on processing the various types of log files. While log data file processing has been recently an issue of investigation by many researchers and developers, the new feature is that of scale: Cloud based systems can enable processing unlimited amount of data either off-line or online in streaming mode. In this work we evaluate the performance of a MapReduce Hadoop-based implementation for processing large log data files of a Virtual Campus. The study aims to reveal the potential of using such implementations as a basis for learning analytics for use by a variety of users in a Virtual Campus. © 2015 IEEE.",Big Data; Cloud Computing; Hadoop; Learning Analytics; Log Files; MapReduce; Massive Processing; Mining; Performance; Virtual Campus,Cloud computing; Data handling; Data mining; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Distributed database systems; Internet; Mining; Online systems; Hadoop; Learning Analytics; Log file; Map-reduce; Performance; Virtual campus; Big data
Data science approach for simulating educational data: Towards the development of teaching outcome model (TOM),"The increasing availability of educational data provides the educational researcher with numerous opportunities to use analytics to extract useful knowledge to enhance teaching and learning. While learning analytics focuses on the collection and analysis of data about students and their learning contexts, teaching analytics focuses on the analysis of the design of the teaching environment and the quality of learning activities provided to students. In this article, we propose a data science approach that incorporates the analysis and delivery of data-driven solution to explore the role of teaching analytics, without compromising issues of privacy, by creating pseudocode that simulates data to help develop test cases of teaching activities. The outcome of this approach is intended to inform the development of a teaching outcome model (TOM), that can be used to inspire and inspect quality of teaching. The simulated approach reported in the research was accomplished through Splunk. Splunk is a Big Data platform designed to collect and analyse high volumes of machine-generated data and render results on a dashboard in real-time. We present the results as a series of visual dashboards illustrating patterns, trends and results in teaching performance. Our research aims to contribute to the development of an educational data science approach to support the culture of data-informed decision making in higher education. © 2018 by the authors.

"A Systematic Literature Review of Business Intelligence Technology, Contribution and Application for Higher Education","Education is one of important program that has always been the goal of the country's strategy to advance the society. Technology is one of various aspect that support the education sector to improve its quality, such as business intelligence. Business intelligence is a technology that is developing today and can help in the decision-making process form large number of data or known as big data analytics. This study identifies the application of business intelligence to the education sector, especially in terms of the technology, contribution, and application using PRISMA. Technology of business intelligence application (Q1) is categorized into two, that are techniques and tools. For the first category, there are four kind of techniques. The techniques are data mining, viable system model (VSM), learning analytics, cloud computing, and behavioural analytics. For the other category, there are several tools that used to apply the business intelligence. The tools are Hadoop, Gephi, BigData by IBM, and web-based. Contributions of business intelligence application (Q2) are knowledge transfer, innovation, and evaluation.

Netflixing human capital development: personalized learning technology and the corporatization of K-12 education,"Abstract: Advanced by powerful venture philanthropies, educational technology companies, and the US Department of Education, a growing movement to apply ‘big data’ through ‘learning analytics’ to create ‘personalized learning’ is currently underway in K-12 education in the United States. While scholars have offered various critiques of the corporate school reform agenda, the role of personalized learning technology in the corporatization of public education has not been extensively examined. Through a content analysis of US Department of Education reports, personalized learning advocacy white papers, and published research monographs, this paper details how big data and adaptive learning systems are functioning to redefine educational policy, teaching, and learning in ways that transfer educational decisions from public school classrooms and teachers to private corporate spaces and authorities. The analysis shows that all three types of documents position education within a reductive set of economic rationalities that emphasize human capital development, the expansion of data-driven instruction and decision-making, and a narrow conception of learning as the acquisition of discrete skills and behavior modification detached from broader social contexts and culturally relevant forms of knowledge and inquiry. The paper concludes by drawing out the contradictions inherent to personalized learning technology and corporatization of schooling. It argues that these contradictions necessitate a broad rethinking of the value and purpose of new educational technology. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",big data; corporatization; educational technology; Personalized learning,
Learning analytics and higher education: a proposed model for establishing informed consent mechanisms to promote student privacy and autonomy,"By tracking, aggregating, and analyzing student profiles along with students’ digital and analog behaviors captured in information systems, universities are beginning to open the black box of education using learning analytics technologies. However, the increase in and usage of sensitive and personal student data present unique privacy concerns. I argue that privacy-as-control of personal information is autonomy promoting, and that students should be informed about these information flows and to what ends their institution is using them. Informed consent is one mechanism by which to accomplish these goals, but Big Data practices challenge the efficacy of this strategy. To ensure the usefulness of informed consent, I argue for the development of Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) technology and assert that privacy dashboards will enable student control and consent mechanisms, while providing an opportunity for institutions to justify their practices according to existing norms and values. © 2019, The Author(s).",Autonomy; Higher education; Informed consent; Learning analytics; Student privacy,
Using a glicko-based algorithm to measure in-course learning,"One significant challenge in the field of measuring ability is measuring the current ability of a learner while they are learning. Many forms of inference become computationally complex in the presence of time-dependent learner ability, and are not feasible to implement in an online context. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach which can estimate learner skill over time even in the presence of large data sets. We use a rating system derived from the Elo rating system and its relatives, which are commonly used in chess and sports tournaments. A learner's submission of a course assignment is interpreted as a single match. We apply this approach to Coursera's online learning platform, which includes millions of learners who have submitted assignments tens of millions of times in over 3000 courses. We demonstrate that this provides reliable estimates of item difficulty and learner ability. Finally, we address how this scoring framework may be used as a basis for various applications that account for a learner's ability, such as adaptive diagnostic tests and personalized recommendations. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

Student and Staff Perspectives on the Use of Big Data in the Tertiary Education Sector: A Scoping Review and Reflection on the Ethical Issues,"While universities routinely use student data to monitor and predict student performance, there has been limited engagement with student and staff views, social and ethical issues, policy development, and ethical guidance. We reviewed peer-reviewed and grey-literature articles of 2007 to 2018 describing the perspectives of staff and students in tertiary education on the use of student-generated data in data analytics, including learning analytics. We used an ethics framework to categorize the findings. There was considerable variation but generally low awareness and understanding amongst students and staff about the nature and extent of data collection, data analytics, and use of predictive analytics. Staff and students identified potential benefits but also expressed concerns about misinterpretation of data, constant surveillance, poor transparency, inadequate support, and potential to impede active learning. This review supports the contention that consideration of ethical issues has failed to keep pace with the development of predictive analytics in the tertiary sector. © 2020 AERA.",big data; data analytics; ethics; perspectives; tertiary education,
Data Consideration for At-Risk Students Early Alert,"In recent years, leveraging big data technology to education domain draws attention. The retention rate of student on campus may be significantly improved if an early alert system based on data analysis is setup and the intervention is appropriately deployed. However, to the best of our knowledge, the existing proposed early alert systems take the whole participants in a group or one single class as analysis target. In this paper, we compare different strategies and methods that deal with the whole participants and groups in different classes to identify the key attributes to improve the accuracy of the proposed early alert systems. Our results in this study indicate that teachers in different classes may make use of different functionality of LMS. Different data volumes are collected in different classes. A robust early alert predictive model needs to take the above into consideration. © 2017 IEEE.",At-risk student; Early alert; Learning analytics; Predictive model,Education; Education computing; Predictive analytics; Students; Teaching; Data technologies; Different class; Early alerts; Education domain; Key attributes; Learning analytics; Predictive modeling; Retention rate; Big data

Can online student performance be forecasted by learning analytics?,"The paper focuses on utilising learning analytics to assess student performance in an online business. The value of this paper is in the literature review and the process used for analysis since it provides a way of how research in Moodle learning analytics or other similar systems could be leveraged to track student progress and for retention. The engagement analytics module is a relatively new component of Moodle but it has not yet been investigated with respect to student performance or in online business courses. The purpose of this study was to examine the predictive relationships between student academic performance and Moodle engagement analytics indicators along with student online activity data from the system logs. Unfortunately none of the hypothesised learning analytics factors were positively related to, nor could they predict, student academic performance. However, several interesting deductions from the learning analytics data gave rise to ideas for further research. Sense making of puzzling statistics suggested a mediating pattern of students' poor self-regulation skills because more focus was put on the assignment requirements but less on interacting with the lesson materials needed to complete the assignment and thereby resulting in lower grades.

Design and implementation of a learning analytics toolkit for teachers,"Learning Analytics can provide powerful tools for teachers in order to support them in the iterative process of improving the effectiveness of their courses and to collaterally enhance their students' performance. In this paper, we present the theoretical background, design, implementation, and evaluation details of eLAT, a Learning Analytics Toolkit, which enables teachers to explore and correlate learning object usage, user properties, user behavior, as well as assessment results based on graphical indicators. The primary aim of the development of eLAT is to process large data sets in microseconds with regard to individual data analysis interests of teachers and data privacy issues, in order to help them to self-reflect on their technology-enhanced teaching and learning scenarios and to identify opportunities for interventions and improvements. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).",EDM; Improving educational software; Learning analytics; Teacher support,
Spatial-data-driven student characterization in higher education,"Higher Education is facing disruptive innovation that requires, among other things, provision of a more effective and customized education service to individual students. In the field of Learning Analytics (LA), there has been much effort, in the form of the collection and thorough analysis of a variety of studentrelated datasets, to optimize learning performance and environments by means of personalization. The datasets include traditional questionnaire surveys, learning management system (LMS) log data of learner activities, and, more recently in the wake of the big-data-analytics trend, unstructured datasets such as SNS activities, text data, and other transactional data. Spatial data, however, is rarely considered as a key dataset, despite its high potential for characterization of students and prediction of their performances and conditions. In this context, the authors propose a new, spatial-data-driven student-characterization research framework. This vision paper describes spatial computing in its three, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive modeling stages as well as its three challenges: (1) technical spatial data acquisition issues; (2) legal and administrative issues; (3) expansion of the application domains in which spatial data can contribute to improved modeling quality. With respect to each challenge, the on-going efforts are briefly introduced in order to substantiate the feasibility of the proposed research framework. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Higher Education; Learning Analytics; Spatial data; Student Characterization,Data acquisition; Forecasting; Information management; Students; Surveys; Disruptive innovations; Higher education; Learning analytics; Learning management system; Learning performance; Questionnaire surveys; Spatial data; Spatial data acquisition; Big data
Beyond engagement analytics: which online mixed-data factors predict student learning outcomes?,"This mixed-method study focuses on online learning analytics, a research area of importance. Several important student attributes and their online activities are examined to identify what seems to work best to predict higher grades. The purpose is to explore the relationships between student grade and key learning engagement factors using a large sample from an online undergraduate business course at an accredited American university (n = 228). Recent studies have discounted the ability to predict student learning outcomes from big data analytics but a few significant indicators have been found by some researchers. Current studies tend to use quantitative factors in learning analytics to forecast outcomes. This study extends that work by testing the common quantitative predictors of learning outcome, but qualitative data is also examined to triangulate the evidence. Pre and post testing of information technology understanding is done at the beginning of the course. First quantitative data is collected, and depending on the hypothesis test results, qualitative data is collected and analyzed with text analytics to uncover patterns. Moodle engagement analytics indicators are tested as predictors in the model. Data is also taken from the Moodle system logs. Qualitative data is collected from student reflection essays. The result was a significant General Linear Model with four online interaction predictors that captured 77.5 % of grade variance in an undergraduate business course. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Big data analytics; Grades; ICT in higher education; Moodle engagement analytics; Online undergraduate business course; Student learning performance,
Role of personality in computer based learning,"With the rapid growth of technology enhanced learning, new mediums for learning have emerged. One of these mediums is computer based learning where the main concern is how to design a computer based learning system which takes into consideration the learners' differences. Personality is considered as one of the most critical sources of individual differences. This study investigates how personality differences within learners can affect computer based learning, through a comprehensive review of the literature. The highlighted results from the obtained nineteen studies are: (a) the most referred to personality model in computer based learning is MBTI; (b) personality traits affect how learners prefer learning content and learning approach like collecting information, communicating with instructor and peer, study behavior, acting and performing; (c) a new model of personality variables should be considered in computer based learning by taking all interested researchers and practitioners into accounts; and (d) the traditional questionnaire approach which is still the pre-dominant method to identify the learner's personality; and this needs to be changed with new potential of big data and learning analytics. Furthermore, this study presents a new implicit approach using learning analytics instead of questionnaire-based approach to identify the learner's personality. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Adaptive learning; Computer based learning; Edutainment; Intelligent tutoring systems; learner's personality; Personality models,Big data; Computer aided instruction; Learning systems; Surveys; Adaptive learning; Computer-based learning; Edutainment; Intelligent tutoring system; learner's personality; E-learning; behavior; human; human experiment; learning; model; personality; physician; questionnaire; scientist
DIY analytics for postsecondary students,"Recently organizations have begun to realize the potential value in the huge amounts of raw, constantly fluctuating data sets that they generate and, with the help of advances in storage and processing technologies, collect. This leads to the phenomenon of big data. This data may be stored in structured format in relational database systems, but may also be stored in an unstructured format. The analysis of these data sets for the discovery of meaningful patterns which can be used to make decisions is known as analytics. Analytics has been enthusiastically adopted by many colleges and universities as a tool to improve student success (by identifying situations which call for early intervention), more effectively target student recruitment efforts, best allocate institutional resources, etc. This application of analytics in higher education is often referred to as learning analytics. While students of post-secondary institutions benefit from many of these efforts, their interests do no coincide perfectly with those of the universities and colleges. In this paper we suggest that post-secondary students might benefit from the use of analytics which are not controlled by the institutions of higher learning - what we call DIY (Do It Yourself) analytics - a set of tools developed specifically to meet the needs and preferences of postsecondary students.

The Givenness of the Human Learning Experience and Its Incompatibility with Information Analytics,"The rise of learning analytics, the application of complex metrics developed to exploit the proliferation of ‘Big Data’ in educational work, raises important moral questions about the nature of what is measurable in education. Teachers, schools and nations are increasingly held to account based on metrics, exacerbating the tendency for fine-grained measurement of learning experiences. In this article, the origins of learning analytics ontology are explored, drawing upon core ideas in the philosophy of computing, such as the general definition of information and the information-theoretic account of knowledge. Drawing upon a reading of Descartes Meditatio II, which extends the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion into a pedagogy of intentionality, the article identifies a fundamental incompatibility between the subjective experience of learning and the information-theoretic account of knowledge. Human subjects experience and value their own information incommensurably with the ways in which computers measure and quantify information. The consequences of this finding for the design of online learning environments, and the necessary limitations of learning analytics and measurement are explored. © 2015 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.",Jean-Luc Marion; learning analytics; philosophy of information; René Descartes,
Analytics within UAE higher education context,"This paper presents the major findings from a study conducted with four different universities in the U.A.E regarding their use of the learning analytics (LA) capabilities available within their learning management systems (LMS). Data was collected from an online survey instrument, in-depth interviews with IT directors and academic administrators, and a case study in Zayed University. The study reveals that while the examined universities seem to recognize and appreciate the new analytics functions available within learning management systems, they seem to struggle with forming a consistent and effective approach to link those functions to improve the decision-making process. Most popular analytics functions include analytics concerned with curriculum coverage, goal performance, student performance, and early alert systems at the course and degree program levels. © 2016 IEEE.",Learning Analytics; Learning Management Systems,Big data; Curricula; Education; Academic administrators; Decision making process; Effective approaches; Higher education; In-depth interviews; Learning Analytics; Learning management system; Student performance; Decision making
"Small data, online learning and assessment practices in higher education: a case study of failure?","In this paper, we present an in-depth case study of a single student who failed an online module which formed part of a master’s programme in Professional Education and Leadership. We use this case study to examine assessment practices in higher education in the online environment. In taking this approach, we go against the current predilection for Big Data which has given rise to ‘learning analytics’, a data-intensive approach to monitoring learning. In particular, we draw attention to the model of the learner produced by learning analytics and to issues of ‘dataveillance’ in online learning. We also use the case to examine assessment in higher education more broadly, exploring the tensions between the requirements for certification and the need for learning. We conclude that assessment practices in higher education may have more to do with ‘quality assurance’ and regulatory frameworks than with ‘enhancing the student experience’ and inculcating the qualities that mark out higher education as an ethical project. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Future-oriented learning; learning analytics; professional learning; teaching excellence framework (TEF),
Learning Analytics Solution for Reducing Learners' Course Failure Rate,"In recent years, learning analytics solutions have highly appealed to the higher education community who mainly focuses on improving the learning process, self-regulated learning skills, and learners' success rate. Learning analytics has to deal with continuous data, however, conventional data mining algorithms are not readily applicable to handle the continuous incoming of learners' data. In order to cope with these scenarios, the proposed learning analytics aimed to manage the continuous data, perform the clustering process using the optimization approach, detect the 'at-risk' learners' who are in a course failure situation, and generate signals to learners and teachers. Based on the predicted outcome, the proposed system identifies and adapts the learning activities and learning contents to help learners find their way out of their learning difficulties and course failure situation. The experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed work using the simulated learners' data. The experimental results provide empirical evidence that the proposed work reduces the course failure rate and improves learners' success rate. © 2015 IEEE.",big data; big data; learner's competence; learning analytics; Naive Bayes prediction; parallel particle swarm optimization clustering; recommendation system,Algorithms; Big data; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Education; Engineering education; Failure analysis; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Recommender systems; Risk perception; Teaching; Conventional data mining; learner's competence; learning analytics; Learning difficulties; Naive bayes; Optimization approach; Parallel particle swarm optimization; Self-regulated learning; Learning systems
Leveraging big data to help each learner and accelerate learning science,"Background: Today's gold standard for identifying what works, the randomized controlled trial, poorly serves each and any individual learner. Elements of my argument provide grounds for proposed remedies in cases where software can log extensive data about operations each learner applies to learn and each bit of information to which a learner applies those operations. Purpose of Study: Analyses of such big data can produce learning analytics that provide raw material for self-regulating learners, for instructors to productively adapt instructional designs, and for learning scientists to advance learning science. I describe an example of such a software system, nStudy. Research Design: I describe and analyze features of nStudy, including bookmarks, quotes, notes, and note artifacts that can be used to generate trace data. Results: By using software like nStudy as they study, learners can partner with instructors and learning scientists in a symbiotic and progressive ecology of authentic experimentation. Conclusion: I argue that software technologies like nStudy offer significant value in supporting learners and advancing learning science. A rationale and recommendations for this approach arise from my critique of pseudo-random controlled trials. © by Teachers College, Columbia University.",,

Investigating Learners' Perception of Learning Analytics Dashboard to Improve Learning Interaction in Online Learning System,"Big data has changed the approach in designing an e-Learning. When students interact with e-Learning content, automatically generating data, we can collect and trace their learning tracks. The data is processed and analyzed, then used to understand the behavioral characteristics of the user or student to enable a personalized learning experience. In this study, learning analytics dashboard was used to improve learning interaction which impacts the learning successfulness. Tests were conducted on 67 students in the Educational Technology Department of the State University of Malang and distributed questionnaires and then analyzed using descriptive methods. The result is that most of the students who take online learning using the learning analytics dashboard find it helpful to carry out self-evaluations of their interaction hence they can manage their learning. The results of the study showed that most participants agreed that LAD could provide information to them regarding their interactions with learning content (M = 4.15, SD = 0.557), learning environment (M = 4.13, SD = 0.457), as well as the participants could conduct problem identification during their learning process (M = 3.88, SD = 0.477). © 2019 IEEE.",learner's perception; learning analytics; learning interaction,Computer aided instruction; Learning systems; Students; Surveys; Behavioral characteristics; Learners' perceptions; learning analytics; Learning environments; Learning interactions; On-line learning systems; Personalized learning; Problem identification; E-learning
Using data mining to analyze high school AP exam pass fail rates,"This study uses data mining analytics techniques including trained multiple regression models to identify the predictors of AP pass rates in CA public high schools using publicly available data from the State of California's Department of Education website. The independent variables included in the analysis explored the relationship of elementary and middle school characteristics such as Math and English Language Arts (ELA) test scores, as well as the degree of poverty at a school represented by the percentage of students qualifying for Free and Reduced-Price Meals (FRPM). Other variables considered were the percentage of English Language Learners (ELL's), the size of the school, special curricular programs (IB program, dual language), whether the school was a charter or traditional public school, as well as the age of the school. The multiple regression model and exploratory correlational analysis, highlighted interaction effects of two key variables, FRPM and ELL's. Our final results indicated that, higher 3rd grade math scores offered some mediating effects protecting against the negative effect of high levels of FRPM and ELL students at a school. 3rd grade Math scores were the best predictor of high school AP pass rates. Unfortunately, the effect of 3rd grade mean math scores was not high enough to completely cancel out the effects of high rates of poverty or being an English language learner. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Investigation of students' attitudes to lectures with text-analysis of questionnaires,"The eventual goal of our study is to help teachers who give lectures in universities and other educational organizations with advising them as well as to help the attending students in order to maximize the learning performance of student. In order to achieve this goal we take the model-based approach. We construct student's learning model at first, and then extract appropriate tips on teaching for teachers and on learning for students. In this paper, as an attempt in this approach, we analyze the text data which were obtained as answers to a term-end questionnaire in a course. Firstly we make a grouping of students based on a correspondence analysis of students and words from the answers to a question about the student's achievement in taking the course. Then we compare these student groups in combination with other data such as examination scores as achievement, and attendance and homework scores as effort, as well as the features of words used in the answered texts. We have found that the students who have good achievement scores often give the comments from a wider view than what they actually learned in the class. On the other hand the students who give the comments using those terms which were taught in the class tends to have low achievement scores. The methods for in-depth analysis used in this paper are supposed to be appropriate tools for complementing the results from using the big data analysis methods and need to be developed more toward the future. © 2013 IEEE.",Correspondence Analysis; Educational Data Mining; Free Description Questionnaire; Lecture Data Analysis; Text Mining,Correspondence analysis; Educational data mining; Educational organizations; Free Description Questionnaire; In-depth analysis; Learning performance; Model based approach; Text mining; Data mining; Information science; Surveys; Teaching; Students
Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO) clustering for learning analytics,"Analytics is all about insights. Learning-oriented insights are the targets for Learning Analytics researchers. Insights could be detected, analysed, or created in the context of variables such as the quality of interactions with the content, study habits, engagement, competence growth, sentiments, learning efficiency, and instructional effectiveness. Clustering techniques offer an effective solution for grouping learners using observed patterns. For instance, learners could be clustered based on the effectiveness of learners' self-regulation initiatives in reaching the target learning outcomes. Each learner could belong to a number of clusters that target different types of insights. One could also analyse the distance between clusters as a means to guide learners towards better performance. Further, one could analyse the effectiveness of cohesive peer groups within and among clusters. Traditional clustering techniques only cope with numerical or categorical data and are not readily applicable in offering learning analytics solutions. In addressing this gap, this research aims to design a Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO) algorithm for the purposes of learning analytics, where the arrival of data is continuous, the types of data is both structured and unstructured, and the volume of data can be significantly large. The research will also describe the application of the PPSO algorithm to detect, analyse, and generate learning-oriented insights. © 2015 IEEE.",clustering; Hadoop Distributed File System; learning analytics; parallel particle swarm optimization; parallel processing,Cluster analysis; File organization; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); clustering; Hadoop distributed file systems; learning analytics; Parallel particle swarm optimization; Parallel processing; Big data
Theoretical Foundations of Virtual and Augmented Reality-Supported Learning Analytics,"A significant body of literature documents the numerous benefits that Virtual (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) supported interventions have brought to the educational scenery, especially with regards to the attainment of the underpinning objectives. At the same time, the vast evolution of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has led to the emergence of a newly formed discipline, the so-called Learning Analytics (LA), which suggests the collection of big data' for the assessment and the evaluation of the educational practices. However, by examining the relevant literature it became apparent that the attempts to blend these topics are limited. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a theoretical framework which accounts the elements that influence the educational processes and the unique features that immersive technologies have. On the grounds of this framework, an effort will be made to design and develop a universal LA system which will support the conduct and evaluation of such interventions in different educational contexts and scientific fields. © 2020 IEEE.",Augmented Reality; Instructional Design; Learning Analytics; STEM Education; Virtual Reality,Augmented reality; Educational context; Educational process; Immersive technologies; Information and Communication Technologies; Supported learning; Theoretical foundations; Theoretical framework; Virtual and augmented reality; E-learning
Towards Data-driven Education with Learning Analytics for Educator 4.0,"Learning analytics has not been extensively used yet as necessary tools in the management and operation of public universities in Malaysia. Massive amount of data been created and collected on students at the faculty but mostly remain dark and unexplored. Generating many reports, having lots of alerts or dashboards does not make a faculty data-driven. To be smart, a faculty must utilize technology to enable and support better planning and decision-making, and to be data-driven, a faculty must have analytics to drive actions for value. This paper intends to explore the impact of IR 4.0 in the field of education and research into the possibility on how a university or a faculty can adapt to IR 4.0 and function in the big data environment. It will present the concept of Education 4.0, data-driven education and learning analytics. To transform, universities must rethink the current teaching practices and then redesign learning to suit future demand. This is discuss next. Finally, it summarizes the roles that educators 4.0 should play in Education 4.0. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Decision making; Digital storage; Data driven; Data environment; Education and researches; Malaysia; Public universities; Teaching practices; Engineering education
Predicting students’ academic performance using multiple linear regression and principal component analysis,"With the rise of big data analytics, learning analytics has become a major trend for improving the quality of education. Learning analytics is a methodology for helping students to succeed in the classroom; the principle is to predict student’s academic performance at an early stage and thus provide them with timely assistance. Accordingly, this study used multiple linear regression (MLR), a popular method of predicting students’ academic performance, to establish a prediction model. Moreover, we combined MLR with principal component analysis (PCA) to improve the predictive accuracy of the model. TraditionalMLR has certain drawbacks; specifically, the coefficient of determination (R2) and mean square error (MSE) measures and the quantile-quantile plot (Q-Q plot) technique cannot evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of MLR. Therefore, we propose predictive MSE (pMSE) and predictive mean absolute percentage correction (pMAPC) measures for determining the predictive performance and accuracy of the regression model, respectively. Analysis results revealed that the proposed model for predicting students’ academic performance could obtain optimal pMSE and pMAPC values by using six components obtained from PCA. © 2018 Information Processing Society of Japan.",Learning analytics; Multiple linear regression; Principal component analysis,
Predicting academic performance of students from VLE big data using deep learning models,"The abundance of accessible educational data, supported by the technology-enhanced learning platforms, provides opportunities to mine learning behavior of students, addressing their issues, optimizing the educational environment, and enabling data-driven decision making. Virtual learning environments complement the learning analytics paradigm by effectively providing datasets for analysing and reporting the learning process of students and its reflection and contribution in their respective performances. This study deploys a deep artificial neural network on a set of unique handcrafted features, extracted from the virtual learning environments clickstream data, to predict at-risk students providing measures for early intervention of such cases. The results show the proposed model to achieve a classification accuracy of 84%–93%. We show that a deep artificial neural network outperforms the baseline logistic regression and support vector machine models. While logistic regression achieves an accuracy of 79.82%–85.60%, the support vector machine achieves 79.95%–89.14%. Aligned with the existing studies - our findings demonstrate the inclusion of legacy data and assessment-related data to impact the model significantly. Students interested in accessing the content of the previous lectures are observed to demonstrate better performance. The study intends to assist institutes in formulating a necessary framework for pedagogical support, facilitating higher education decision-making process towards sustainable education. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Educational data; Learning analytics; Machine learning; Predicting success; Virtual learning environments (VLE),Big data; Computer aided instruction; Decision making; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Students; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; Educational data; Learning analytics; Predicting academic performance; Predicting success; Support vector machine models; Technology enhanced learning; Virtual learning environments; E-learning; article; big data; controlled study; decision making; deep learning; deep neural network; early intervention; education; human; human experiment; learning environment; support vector machine
Profiling language learners in the big data era,"The educational data revolution has empowered universities and educational institutes with rich data on their students, including information on their academic data (e.g., program completion, course enrolment, grades), learning activities (e.g., learning materials reviewed, discussion forum interactions, learning videos watched, projects conducted), learning process (i.e., time, place, path or pace of learning activities), learning experience (e.g., reflections, views, preferences) and assessment results. In this paper, we apply clustering to profile students from one of the largest Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in the field of Second Language Learning. We first analyse the profiles, revealing the diversity among students taking the same course. We then, referring to the results of our analysis, discuss how profiling as a tool can be utilised to identify at-risk students, improve course design and delivery, provide targeted teaching practices, compare and contrast different offerings to evaluate interventions, develop policy, and improve self-regulation in students. The findings have implications for the fields of personalised learning and differentiated instruction. © ASCILITE 2019 Singapore University of Social Sciences.

Student data mining solution-knowledge management system related to higher education institutions,"Higher education institutions (HEIs) are often curious whether students will be successful or not during their study. Before or during their courses the academic institutions try to estimate the percentage of successful students. But is it possible to predict the success rate of students enrolled in their courses? Are there any specific student characteristics, which can be associated with the student success rate? Is there any relevant student data available to HEIs on the basis of which they could predict the student success rate? The answers to the above research questions can generally be obtained using data mining tools. Unfortunately, data mining algorithms work best with large data sets, while student data, available to HEIs, related to courses are limited and falls into the category of small data sets. Thus, the study focuses on data mining for small student data sets and aims to answer the above research questions by comparing two different data mining tools. The conclusions of this study are very promising and will encourage HEIs to incorporate data mining tools as an important part of their higher education knowledge management systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Clickstream for learning analytics to assess students’ behavior with Scratch,"The construction of knowledge through computational practice requires to teachers a substantial amount of time and effort to evaluate programming skills, to understand and to glimpse the evolution of the students and finally to state a quantitative judgment in learning assessment. The field of learning analytics has been a common practice in research since last years due to their great possibilities in terms of learning improvement. Both, Big and Small data techniques support the analysis cycle of learning analytics and risk of students’ failure prediction. Such possibilities can be a strong positive contribution to the field of computational practice such as programming. Our main objective was to help teachers in their assessments through to make those possibilities effective. Thus, we have developed a functional solution to categorize and understand students’ behavior in programming activities based in Scratch. Through collection and analysis of data generated by students’ clicks in Scratch, we proceed to execute both exploratory and predictive analytics to detect patterns in students’ behavior when developing solutions for assignments. We concluded that resultant taxonomy could help teachers to better support their students by giving real-time quality feedback and act before students deliver incorrectly or at least incomplete tasks. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Big data; Clickstream; Learning analytics; Programming; Scratch,Behavioral research; Big data; Functional programming; Mathematical programming; Predictive analytics; Risk assessment; Clickstreams; Developing solutions; Functional solution; Learning analytics; Learning assessment; Programming activities; Programming skills; Scratch; Students
Give Me a Customizable Dashboard: Personalized Learning Analytics Dashboards in Higher Education,"With the increased capability of learning analytics in higher education, more institutions are developing or implementing student dashboards. Despite the emergence of dashboards as an easy way to present data to students, students have had limited involvement in the dashboard development process. As part of a larger program of research examining student and academic perceptions of learning analytics, we report here on work in progress exploring student perceptions of dashboards and student preferences for dashboard features. First, we present findings on higher education students’ attitudes towards learning analytic dashboards resulting from four focus groups (N = 41). Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts identified five key themes relating to dashboards: ‘provide everyone with the same learning opportunities’, ‘to compare or not to compare’, ‘dashboard privacy’, ‘automate alerts’ and ‘make it meaningful—give me a customizable dashboard’. Next we present findings from a content analysis of students’ drawings of dashboards demonstrating that students are interested in features that support learning opportunities, provide comparisons to peers and are meaningful to the student. Finally, we present preliminary findings from a survey of higher education students, reinforcing students’ desire to choose whether to have a dashboard and to be able to customize their dashboards. These findings highlight the potential for providing students with some level of control over learning analytics as a means to increasing self-regulated learning and academic achievement. Future research directions aimed at better understanding students emotional and behavioral responses to learning analytics feedback on dashboards and alerts are outlined. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Big data; Higher education; Learning analytics; Student attitudes; Student dashboards,Big data; Education; Academic achievements; Future research directions; Higher education; Higher education students; Learning analytics; Personalized learning; Self-regulated learning; Student attitudes; Students
Conversation trainings - Towards a multidimensional visualization of learning flows,"Conversation trainings are an e-learning method designed for the transfer of communication-related skills.

What can we learn from learning analytics? A case study based on an analysis of student use of video recordings,"Over recent years the use of lecture capture technology has become widespread in higher education. However, clear evidence of the learning benefits of this technology is limited, with contradictory findings reported in the literature. The reasons for this lack of consistent evidence may include methodological issues and differences in the context of previous studies. This paper describes a study using server log data to explore student use of video recordings quantitatively in the context of science courses at Imperial College London. The study had two aims: to understand more about the general principles that underpin a learning analytics study and to seek answers to the following specific research questions: (1) How much use is made of video recordings? (2) How does the use of recordings in a module vary over time? (3) Is the use of recordings different for different modules or subjects? (4) Is the use of recordings different for subgroups of students, for example, students with specific learning differences or English as a second language, students attaining different grades? (5) Is the use of recordings different for different types of content? Using learning analytics enabled the discovery of context-specific actionable insights: recommendations for both staff and students and ideas for further research. General conclusions were also drawn on how best to undertake learning analytics studies in order to deliver evidence and insights to improve learning and teaching. © 2018 M. Sarsfield and J.

eLAT: An exploratory learning analytics tool for reflection and iterative improvement of technology enhanced learning,"Educators are in need for powerful Learning Analytics tools in order to improve the effectiveness of their courses and to enhance their students' performance. In order to help educators to self-reflect on their technology-enhanced teaching and learning scenarios and to help them identify opportunities for interventions and improvements, it is important to provide comprehensible indicators for determining quality and efficiency. In this paper, we present an overview on the goals, requirements, and design of eLAT, a Learning Analytics toolkit which enables teachers to explore and correlate content usage, user properties, user behavior, as well as assessment results based on graphical indicators. The primary aim of eLAT is to process large data sets in real time with regard to individual research interests of teachers and data privacy issues.",Evaluating teaching interventions; Improving educational software; Improving teacher support; Learning analytics,Educational software; Exploratory learning; Iterative improvements; Large datasets; Learning analytics; Privacy issue; Real time; Teaching and learning; Teaching intervention; Technology enhanced learning; User behaviors; Data mining; Data privacy; Engineering education; Behavioral research
"Knowing You: Personal Tutoring, Learning Analytics and the Johari Window","Recent decades have seen increased concern for the student experience by higher education institutions, along with more pressure on students due to the highly competitive job market and the financial implications of doing a degree. The growth in the number of non-traditional students attending higher education has added to pressures on students and staff. There are impacts on the mental health and well-being of both as university education becomes massified, commodified and increasingly time-pressured. In this context, informed and kindly human interaction is crucial to mitigate negative influences. However, staff are less likely than ever to know their students well enough to have meaningful and impactful exchanges. Student record systems and learning analytics present themselves as a promising tool to be used in finding solutions to the complex problems of student achievement and well-being. This conceptual paper explores the use of big data and learning analytics to facilitate the work of personal tutors (academic advisors), illustrated by practical examples from the Student Support System used at the University of Plymouth. It will argue that learning analytics systems have the potential to facilitate communication and sharing of information, and thus enhance the quality of communication between personal tutors and their tutees to improve student engagement and support the tutee. However, the major contention of the paper is that information requires the lens of a humanistic framework in order to be transformed into knowledge and insight. The heuristic of the Johari Window is presented as a possible tool to stimulate thinking and to integrate the information from learning analytics into a meaningful framework in order to develop a powerful way of knowing tutees better and thus creating more supportive relationships with them. As such, the paper proposes an original contribution to the underexplored field of the use of learning analytics in personal tutoring in the UK, and hopes to stimulate empirical research in this area. © Copyright © 2020 Lowes.",dashboards; higher education; Johari Window; learning analytics; personal tutoring,
Automated insightful drill-down recommendations for learning analytics dashboards,"The big data revolution is an exciting opportunity for universities, which typically have rich and complex digital data on their learners. It has motivated many universities around the world to invest in the development and implementation of learning analytics dashboards (LADs). These dashboards commonly make use of interactive visualisation widgets to assist educators in understanding and making informed decisions about the learning process.Acommon operation in analytical dashboards is a 'drill-down', which in an educational setting allows users to explore the behaviour of sub-populations of learners by progressively adding filters. Nevertheless, drill-down challenges exist, which hamper the most effective use of the data, especially by users without a formal background in data analysis. Accordingly, in this paper, we address this problem by proposing an approach that recommends insightful drill-downs to LAD users. We present results from an application of our proposed approach using an existing LAD. A set of insightful drill-down criteria from a course with 875 students are explored and discussed. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Decision trees; Drill-down analysis; Exploratory data analysis; Learning analytics dashboards,Data handling; Decision trees; Drills; Information analysis; Trees (mathematics); Digital datas; Drill-down; Educational settings; Exploratory data analysis; Informed decision; Interactive visualisation; Learning analytics dashboards; Sub-populations; Infill drilling
The Argument for a “Data Cube” for Large-Scale Psychometric Data,"In recent years, work with educational testing data has changed due to the affordances provided by technology, the availability of large data sets, and by the advances made in data mining and machine learning. Consequently, data analysis has moved from traditional psychometrics to computational psychometrics. Despite advances in the methodology and the availability of the large data sets collected at each administration, the way assessment data is collected, stored, and analyzed by testing organizations is not conducive to these real-time, data intensive computational methods that can reveal new patterns and information about students. In this paper, we propose a new way to label, collect, and store data from large scale educational learning and assessment systems (LAS) using the concept of the “data cube.” This paradigm will make the application of machine-learning, learning analytics, and complex analyses possible. It will also allow for storing the content for tests (items) and instruction (videos, simulations, items with scaffolds) as data, which opens up new avenues for personalized learning. This data paradigm will allow us to innovate at a scale far beyond the hypothesis-driven, small-scale research that has characterized educational research in the past. © Copyright © 2019 von Davier, Wong, Polyak and Yudelson.",data standards; database alignment; diagnostic models; learning analytics; learning pathways,
Mining big data to help make informed decisions for designing effective digital educational games,"More research is needed on how to best use analytics to support educational decisions and design effective learning environments. This study was to explore and mine the data captured by a digital educational game designed for middle school science to understand learners’ behavioral patterns in using the game, and to use evidence-based findings to inform the design and implementation of the game’s next iteration. The data was from 3,963 sixth-grade students from 31 teachers across nine U.S. states who used the game. The dataset consisted of 3,063,267 lines of log data. The findings showed significant positive relationships between students' performance scores and their tool usage in terms of both frequency and duration of tool use. This was further confirmed by the relationships between different levels of students’ performance and tool usage: the more frequently and longer that students used the tools, the higher their performance scores, and there were significant differences between students with high performance scores and those with low performance scores. Comparing three different cases over the individual days of game use provided further evidence that in all three comparisons, the students who used more essential tools and for longer time had higher performance scores. Implications are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",behavioral patterns; digital games; Educational big data; learning analytics; middle school science,
Early Detection of At-Risk Students Using Machine Learning Based on LMS Log Data,"Analytics in education has been received much attention over the past decade. It is necessary to maintain high retention rate in any institutions of higher education, therefore several attempts on the application of analytics have been done for this problem. To detect students at high drop-out risk early and intervene them effectively, utilizing the educational big data can be useful. In this paper, an automatic detection method of academically at-risk students by using log data of learning management systems is considered. Some well-known machine learning methods are used to build a predictive model of student performance evaluated by GPA. By using actual data set, we investigate an availability of the proposed method and discuss its ability to early detection of off-task behavior. The experimental results indicated that some characteristics of behavior about learning which affect the learning outcomes can be detected with only the online log data. Furthermore, comparative importance of explanatory variables obtained by the approach would help to estimate which variable affects comparatively to the learning outcome and it can be used in institutional research. © 2017 IEEE.",Detection of at-risk students; Enrollment management; Institutional research; Learning analytics; LMS log data; Machine learning,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Education computing; Information management; Learning systems; Societies and institutions; Students; Automatic detection method; Enrollment management; Explanatory variables; Institutions of higher educations; Learning analytics; Learning management system; Log data; Machine learning methods; Education
Learning Analytics - Need of Centralized Portal for Access to E-Learning Resources,"Recently, e-learning resources become widespread in school education worldwide, as they are a prerequisite for an efficient learning process. These resources are scattered across many websites and their search takes too long. Despite their diversity, often it is difficult for teachers to find the proper resources. After analyzing the findings of an anonymous online survey of Bulgarian teachers on the use of ICT and e-learning resources, researchers identified the need for easy access to various e-resources for school education. The paper offers a concept for a centralized access portal where users to upload links to e-learning resources that are shortly described and classified according to several indicators. These include accessibility, type, subject, school grade, purpose and other meaningful parameters. Free registration for teachers and students will allow data to be aggregated by user groups, to carry out analyzes of the resources' usage, to draw trends, and to make conclusions for future policies. © 2019 IEEE.",Big Data; centralized access portal; learning analytics; open educational resources; school education,Big data; Control systems; Systems engineering; E-learning resources; Efficient learning; learning analytics; Online surveys; Open educational resources; School education; User groups; E-learning
crsra: A learning analytics tool for understanding student behaviour in massive open online courses,"Due to the fundamental differences between traditional education and massive open online courses (MOOCs), and because of the ever-increasing popularity of the latter, more research is needed to understand current and future trends in MOOCs. Although research in the field has grown rapidly in recent years, one of the main challenges facing researchers remains the complexity and messiness of the data. Therefore, it is imperative to provide tools that pave the way for more research on this new subject. This paper introduces a package called crsra based on the statistical software R to help tidy and perform preliminary analysis on massive loads of data provided by Coursera. The advantages of the package are as follows: (a) faster loading and organizing of data for analysis, (b) an efficient method for combining data from multiple courses and even from across institutions, and (c) provision of a set of functions for analyzing student behaviours. © 2019, UTS ePRESS.

Demographic indicators influencing learning activities in MOOCs: Learning analytics of futurelearn courses,"Big data and analytics for educational information systems, despite having gained researchers’ attention, are still in their infancy and will take years to mature. Massive open online courses (MOOCs), which record learner-computer interactions, bring unprecedented opportunities to analyse learner activities at a very fine granularity, using very large datasets. To date, studies have focused mainly on dropout and completion rates. This study explores learning activities in MOOCs against their demographic indicators. In particular, pre-course survey data and online learner interaction data collected from two MOOCs, delivered by the University of Warwick, in 2015, 2016, and 2017, are used, to explore how learner demographic indicators may influence learner activities.

VideoMark: A video-based learning analytic technique for MOOCs,"The massive online open course (MOOC) revolution offers opportunities for learning analytics regarding the diversity in learning activities of MOOCs. In MOOCs, video lectures represent the principal learning resource, and learners spend most of their time engaged in self-paced, independent learning. Therefore, MOOCs present an innovative form of video-based learning. How to improve this learning environment by adding additional features to video lectures represents a path for progress. Few studies have investigated the interaction between learners and the video content; however, improvement in this domain is necessary. This paper proposes a video-based learning analysis approach called VideoMark, which enables learners to judiciously review, consolidate, and clarify specific concepts introduced in MOOCs. This analytical approach can be applied to MOOC-style ShareCourse programs in Taiwan. Finally, this analytical approach is presented as a visual keyword cloud for learners to clarify specific learning concepts in the MOOC learning process. © 2017 IEEE.",Learning analytics; learning behaviors; learning processes; massive online open courses (MOOCs); video-based learning,Big data; Computer aided instruction; Data handling; E-learning; Information analysis; Learning systems; Learning analytics; Learning behavior; Learning process; massive online open courses (MOOCs); video-based learning; Education
A generic model for the context-aware representation and federation of educational datasets: Experience from the dataTEL challenge,"Research on online interactions during a learning situation to better understand users' practices and to provide them with quality-oriented features, resources and services is attracting a large community. As a result, the interest for sharing educational data sets that translate the interactions of users with e-learning systems has become a hot topic today. However, the current systems aggregating social and usage data about their users suffer from a series of weaknesses. In particular, they lack a common information model that would allow for exchanges of interaction data at a large scale. To tackle this issue, we propose in this paper a generic model able to federate heterogeneous context metadata and to facilitate their share and reuse. This framework has been successfully applied to several data sets provided by the research community, and thus gives access to a big data set that could help researchers to increase efficiency of existing learning analytics technics, and promote research and development of new algorithms and services on top of these data.",Context metadata; Knowledge management; Knowledge modelling; Learning analytics,
A learning analytics theoretical framework for stem education virtual reality applications,"While virtual reality has attracted educators’ interest by providing new opportunities to the learning process and assessment in different science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, the results from previous studies indicate that there is still much work to be done when large data collection and analysis is considered. At the same time, learning analytics emerged with the promise to revolutionise the traditional practices by introducing new ways to systematically assess and improve the effectiveness of instruction. However, the collection of ‘big’ educational data is mostly associated with web-based platforms (i.e., learning management systems) as they offer direct access to students’ data with minimal effort. Thence, in the context of this work, we present a four-dimensional theoretical framework for virtual reality-supported instruction and propose a set of structural elements that can be utilised in conjunction with a learning analytics prototype system. The outcomes of this work are expected to support practitioners on how to maximise the potential of their interventions and provide further inspiration for the development of new ones. © 2020 by the authors.

State of the art of learning analytics in higher education,"One of the characteristics of our world today is that it is continuously changing. Every aspect of our world has been transformed by the emerging technologies, ranging from our day to day activities to scientific and industrial developments. This progress has been made in the last few decades. It is also true for all aspects of education. The use of emerging technologies at all levels of education, such as intelligent tutoring systems, learning management systems, interactive learning environments, and online learning, gives access to vast volumes of data of the students. Student data collected automatically in online learning environments are usually not converted into useful information for teaching, although it is a good source of information. It is poorly used throughout the educational domain. A new concept has emerged to capture this educational big data called “Learning Analytics”. LA is about discovering hidden patterns in the educational process, assess student learning, and make predictions, which in turn provide a better understanding of teaching, learning, and interpretation of student’s data. Higher education institutes are adapting to the evolving concept of LA. It would help HEI’s to facilitates students to improve academic performance and enable teachers to keep track of individual students, identify student at-risk, and provide timely interventions. This paper provides the bird’s eye view of the research evidence on the usage of learning analytics in higher education across the world by reviewing the leading publications, research studies, and case studies in this area. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Quasi-experimental design for causal inference using Python and Apache Spark: A hands-on tutorial,"Educational practitioners and policy makers require evidence supporting claims about educational efficacy. Evidence is often found using causal relationships between education inputs and student learning outcomes. Causal inference covers a wide range of topics in education research, including efficacy studies to prove if a new policy, software, curriculum or intervention is effective in improving student learning outcomes. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are considered a gold standard method to demonstrate causality. However, these studies are expensive, timely and costly, as well as not being ethical to conduct in many educational contexts. Causality can also be deducted purely from observational data. In this tutorial, we will review methodologies for estimating the causal effects of education inputs on student learning outcomes using observational data. This is an inherently complex task due to many hidden variables and their interrelationships in educational research. In this tutorial, we discuss causal inference in the context of educational research with big data.

Design of a personalized massive open online course platform,"Focusing on the massive open online course (MOOC) platform,the purpose of this study is to realize personalized adaptive learning accordingto the needs and abilities of each learner. To this end, the author created a personalizedadaptive learning behaviour analysis model, and designed a personalizedMOOC platform based on the model. Through the analysis of learning behaviourson the MOOC platform, the model digs deep into the pattern of learningbehaviours, and lays the basis for personalized intervention in the learningprocess. The comparison experiments show that our prediction method is moreaccurate than the other prediction algorithms.

Implementation of change data capture in ETL process for data warehouse using HDFS and apache spark,"This study aims to increase ETL process efficiency flud reduce processing time by applying the method of Change Data Capture (CDC) in distributed system using Hadoop Distributed file System (HDFS) and Apache Spark in the data warehouse of Learning Analytics system of Universitas Indonesia. Usually, increases in I lie number of records in the data source result in an increase in ETL processing time for the data warehouse system. This condition occurs as a result of inefficient ETL process using the full load method. Using the tull load method, ETL has to process the same number of records as the number of records in the data sources. The proposed ETL model design with the application of CDC method using HDFS and Apache Spark can reduce the amount of data in the ETL process. Consequently, the process becomes more efficient and the ETL processing time Is reduced approximately 53% in average. © 2017 IEEE.",big data; change data capture; data warehouse; distributed system; extract transform load,Data mining; Data warehouses; File organization; Security of data; Change Data Capture (CDC); Data warehouse systems; Distributed systems; Extract transform loads; Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS); Learning analytics; Load methods; Processing time; Big data
Learning analytics to assess students’ behavior with scratch through clickstream,"The construction of knowledge through computational practice requires to teachers a substantial amount of time and effort to evaluate programming skills, to understand and to glimpse the evolution of the students and finally to state a quantitative judgment in learning assessment. This suposes a huge problem of time and no adecuate intime feedback to students while practicing programming activities. The field of learning analytics has been a common practice in research since last years due their great possibilities in terms of learning improvement. Such possibilities can be a strong positive contribution in the field of computational practice such as programming. In this work we attempt to use learning analytics to ensure intime and quality feedback through the analysis of students behavior in programming practice. Hence, in order to help teachers in their assessments we propose a solution to categorize and understand students’ behavior in programming activities using business technics such as web clickstream. Clickstream is a technique that consists in the collection and analysis of data generated by users. We applied it in learning programming environments to study students behavior to enhance students learning and programming skills. The results of the work supports this business technique as useful and adequate in programming practice. The main finding showns a first taxonomy of programming behaviors that can easily be used in a classroom. This will help teachers to understand how students behave in their practice and consequently enhance assessment and students’ following-up to avoid examination failures.

Learning about learning at scale: Methodological challenges and recommendations,"Learning at scale opens up a new frontier to learn about learning. Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) and similar large-scale online learning platforms give an unprecedented view of learners' behavior whilst learning. In this paper, we argue that the abundance of data that results from such platforms not only brings novel opportunities to the study of learning, but also bears novel methodological challenges. We show that the resulting data comes with various challenges with respect to the granular, observational, and large nature of these data. Additionally, we discuss a series of potential solutions, such as sharing validated models and performing pre-registered confirmatory research. With these contributions, this paper aims to increase awareness and understanding of both the strengths and challenges of research on learning at scale. © 2017 ACM.",Behavioral traces; Big data; Learning analytics; Online learning; Research methodology; Research validity,Big data; Behavioral trace; Learning analytics; Online learning; Research methodologies; E-learning
Predicting student satisfaction and outcomes in online courses using learning activity indicators,"The premise for this study was that learner interaction in an online web-based course could be assessed in relation to academic performance, or in other words, e-learning. Although some studies reveal that learner interaction with online content is related to student academic performance, it remains unproven whether this is casual, or even if there may be a significant correlation. Thus, this study seeks to measure if there is a directional and then a casual relationship between student online academic performance, engagement analytics and other online activity factors. A unique aspect of this study is that data is collected from Moodle engagement analytics as well as from the activity logs. Student academic performance is measured based on the grade achieved from an assessment designed to map to the course learning objectives.

"Governing software: networks, databases and algorithmic power in the digital governance of public education","This article examines the emergence of ‘digital governance’ in public education in England. Drawing on and combining concepts from software studies, policy and political studies, it identifies some specific approaches to digital governance facilitated by network-based communications and database-driven information processing software that are being discursively promoted in education by cross-sectoral intermediary organizations. Such intermediaries, including National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, Demos, the Innovation Unit, the Education Foundation and the Nominet Trust, are increasingly seeking to participate in new digitally mediated forms of educational governance. Through their promotion of network-based pedagogies and database-driven analytics software, these organizations are seeking to delegate educational decision-making to socio-algorithmic forms of power that have the capacity to predict, govern and activate learners' capacities and subjectivities. © 2014, © 2014 The Author(s).

Multimodal Data Value Chain (M-DVC): A Conceptual Tool to Support the Development of Multimodal Learning Analytics Solutions,"Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) systems, understood as those that exploit multimodal evidence of learning to better model a learning situation, have not yet spread widely in educational practice. Their inherent technical complexity, and the lack of educational stakeholder involvement in their design, are among the hypothesized reasons for the slow uptake of this emergent field. To aid in the process of stakeholder communication and systematization leading to the specification of MMLA systems, this paper proposes a Multimodal Data Value Chain (M-DVC). This conceptual tool, derived from both the field of Big Data and the needs of MMLA scenarios, has been evaluated in terms of its usefulness for stakeholders, in three authentic case studies of MMLA systems currently under development. The results of our mixed-methods evaluation highlight the usefulness of the M-DVC to elicit unspoken assumptions or unclear data processing steps in the initial stages of development. The evaluation also revealed limitations of the M-DVC in terms of the technical terminology employed, and the need for more detailed contextual information to be included. These limitations also prompt potential improvements for the M-DVC, on the path towards clearer specification and communication within the multi-disciplinary teams needed to build educationally-meaningful MMLA solutions. © 2013 IEEE.",Conceptual tools; Data Value Chain; Evaluation; Multimodal Learning Analytics; Stakeholder communication; Usefulness,Specifications; Terminology; Contextual information; Learning situation; Multi-disciplinary teams; Multi-modal learning; Stakeholder communications; Stakeholder involvement; Technical complexity; Technical terminology; Data handling
Parallelizing Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Tool for Large-scale Online Learning Analytics,"With the advent of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), the data scale of student learning behavior and knowledge mastery has significantly increased. In order to effectively and efficiently analyze these datasets and present on-the-fly intelligent tutoring to online learners, it is necessary to improve existing learning analytics tools in a parallel and automatic way. One of the most common tools is Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) that can model temporal progress of online learners and evaluate their mastery of course knowledge. Current implementation of BKT is mostly based on single machine, which leads to slow execution performance during its Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm for parameter fitting. Although there are a few parallel implementations for EM algorithm, they don't support automatic initial BKT parameter tuning to ensure the correct convergence of the EM iteration. Therefore, this paper presents a new parallel BKT open source tool based on the Spark computational framework with the method of automatic tuning of initial parameters. This tool improves traditional knowledge tracing systems using a parallel EM algorithm with the capabilty of automatically choosing initial parameters. Experimental result demonstrates that our tool can achieve fast execution speed and greatly improve the accuracy of training parameters on both different sizes of simulated data and real educational data sets. © 2018 IEEE.",Knowledge Tracing; Learning analytics; Parallel EM Algorithm; Parameter sweeping,Big data; Iterative methods; Maximum principle; Parameter estimation; Bayesian knowledge tracings; Computational framework; EM algorithms; Expectation-maximization algorithms; Knowledge tracings; Learning analytics; Parallel implementations; Parameter sweeping; E-learning
Enhanced Harris Hawks optimization as a feature selection for the prediction of student performance,"Predicting student performance for educational organizations such as universities, community colleges, schools, and training centers will enhance the overall results of these organizations. Big data can be extracted from the internal systems of these organizations, such as exam records, statistics about virtual courses, and e-learning systems. Finding meaningful knowledge from extracted data is a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed a modified version of Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm by controlling the population diversity to overcome the early convergence problem and prevent trapping in a local optimum. The proposed approach is employed as a feature selection algorithm to discover the most valuable features for student performance prediction problem. A dynamic controller that controls the population diversity by observing the performance of HHO using the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm as a clustering approach. Once all solutions belong to one cluster, an injection process is employed to redistribute the solutions over the search space. A set of machine learning classifiers such as kNN, Layered recurrent neural network (LRNN), Naïve Bayes, and Artificial Neural Network are used to evaluate the overall prediction system. A real dataset obtained from UCI machine learning repository is adopted in this paper. The obtained results show the importance of predicting students’ performance at an earlier stage to avoid students’ failure and improve the overall performance of the educational organization. Moreover, the reported results show that the combination between the enhanced HHO and LRNN can outperform other classifiers with accuracy equal to 92 % , since LRNN is a deep learning algorithm that is able to learn from previous and current input values. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, AT part of Springer Nature.",Educational data mining; Harris Hawks optimization; Population diversity; Student performance,Clustering algorithms; Data mining; E-learning; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Nearest neighbor search; Network layers; Recurrent neural networks; Students; Clustering approach; Educational organizations; Feature selection algorithm; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Population diversity; Prediction systems; Student performance; UCI machine learning repository; Learning algorithms
"Assessing collaborative learning: big data, analytics and university futures","Assessment in higher education has focused on the performance of individual students. This focus has been a practical as well as an epistemic one: methods of assessment are constrained by the technology of the day, and in the past they required the completion by individuals under controlled conditions of set-piece academic exercises. Recent advances in learning analytics, drawing upon vast sets of digitally stored student activity data, open new practical and epistemic possibilities for assessment, and carry the potential to transform higher education. It is becoming practicable to assess the individual and collective performance of team members working on complex projects that closely simulate the professional contexts that graduates will encounter. In addition to academic knowledge, this authentic assessment can include a diverse range of personal qualities and dispositions that are key to the computer-supported cooperative working of professionals in the knowledge economy. This paper explores the implications of such opportunities for the purpose and practices of assessment in higher education, as universities adapt their institutional missions to address twenty-first century needs. The paper concludes with a strong recommendation for university leaders to deploy analytics to support and evaluate the collaborative learning of students working in realistic contexts. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",authentic assessment; collaborative learning; situated learning; Social learning analytics,
Student-Facing Educational Dashboard Design for Online Learners,"The current shift from traditional classrooms to online learning in higher education calls for more attention to self-regulated learning. This research is motivated by the growing interest in potential of using learning analytics dashboard (LAD) to increase individuals' self-regulation by creating visibility into their performance in various applications. This study explores how data visualization can be integrated with online learning to improve learners' performance through enhancing their skills in planning and organization. We are working on the design of a comprehensive LAD, focusing on micro-level of learning analytics to support learning activities of students. The LAD includes the following two features to enhance students' self-regulation in online learning: (1) a function to track students' progress compared to other students' over time; (2) reminders to help students with upcoming deadlines and auto-generating to do lists. The hypothesis is that the LAD will increase students' engagement, motivation, and self-regulation in an online learning environment. This study is significant because it contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring how student-generated data can be used to improve self-regulated learning. The practical contribution of this study is to create a personalized LAD for students based on the learner-generated data to benefit students' organization skill, planning skill, and motivation. © 2020 IEEE.",data mining; information visualization; learning analytics dashboard; learning management system; online learning; self-regulated learning,Big data; Computer aided instruction; Data visualization; Deregulation; E-learning; Motivation; Body of knowledge; Higher education; Online learning; Online learning environment; Self regulation; Self-regulated learning; Students' engagements; Support learning; Students
Using Data to Understand How to Better Design Adaptive Learning,"There is much enthusiasm in higher education about the benefits of adaptive learning and using big data to investigate learning processes to make data-informed educational decisions. The benefits of adaptive learning to achieve personalized learning are obvious. Yet, there lacks evidence-based research to understand how data such as user behavior patterns can be used to design effective adaptive learning systems. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to investigate what behavior patterns learners with different characteristics demonstrate when they interact with an adaptive learning environment. Incoming 1st-year students in a pharmacy professional degree program engaged in an adaptive learning intervention that aimed to provide remedial instruction to better prepare these professional students before they began their formal degree program. We analyzed the participants’ behavior patterns through the usage data to understand how they used the adaptive system based upon their needs and interests. Using both statistical analyses and data visualization techniques, this study found: (1) apart from learners’ cognitive ability, it is important to consider affective factors such as motivation in adaptive learning, (2) lack of alignment among various components in an adaptive system can impact how learners accessed the system and, more importantly, their performance, and (3) visualizations can reveal interesting findings that can be missed otherwise. Such research should provide much needed empirical evidences and useful insights about how the analytics can inform the effective designs of adaptive learning. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Adaptive learning; Data visualization; Learning analytics; Personalized learning,Adaptive systems; Behavioral research; Big data; Computer aided instruction; Data visualization; Learning systems; Students; Visualization; Adaptive learning; Adaptive learning environment; Adaptive learning systems; Evidence based researches; Learning analytics; Personalized learning; User behavior patterns; Visualization technique; Education
Revealing the Hidden patterns: A comparative study on profiling subpopulations of MOOC students,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) exhibit a remarkable heterogeneity of students. The advent of complex ""big data"" from MOOC platforms is a challenging yet rewarding opportunity to deeply understand how students are engaged in MOOCs. Past research, looking mainly into overall behavior, may have missed patterns related to student diversity. Using a large dataset from a MOOC offered by FutureLearn, we delve into a new way of investigating hidden patterns through both machine learning and statistical modelling. In this paper, we report on clustering analysis of student activities and comparative analysis on both behavioral patterns and demographical patterns between student subpopulations in the MOOC. Our approach allows for a deeper understanding of how MOOC students behave and achieve. Our findings may be used to design adaptive strategies towards an enhanced MOOC experience. © ISD 2019.

Estimation of the Error Factors in Programming Exercises Based on Dynamic Revisions of Case-Bases,"This research was aimed at developing methods for estimating error factors in programming exercises so that professors could effectively guide students based on an understanding of stumbling by novice students. We first developed a method for simultaneously estimating compilation, logic errors by using case-bases. Moreover, we developed a mechanism for dynamically revising error factor case-bases by using students' feedback:- evaluations against the estimated error factors, their reports on new error factors. We then designed a support system of programming language exercises by introducing our methods. This system enabled more practical indications of error factors than the existing systems. Features of our methods are discussed based on the results of experiments. © 2016 IEEE.",Case Base Inference; Compile Error; Learning Analytics; Logic Error; Programming exrcise,Big data; Case based reasoning; Computation theory; Education; Errors; Students; Trusted computing; Ubiquitous computing; Case base; Estimated error; Estimation of the error; Existing systems; Learning Analytics; Logic errors; Programming exercise; Support systems; Computer circuits
Open Learner Models Working in Symbiosis With Self-Regulating Learners: A Research Agenda,"Learner modeling systems so far formulated model learning in three main ways: a learner’s “position” within a lattice of declarative and procedural knowledge about highly structured disciplines such as geometry or physics, a learner’s path through curricular tasks compared to milestones, or profiles of a learner’s achievements on a set of tasks relative to mastery criteria or a peer group. Opening these models to learners identifies for them factors and relations among factors. Open learner models tacitly invite learners to regulate learning. However, contemporary learner models omit data about how learners have and should process information to learn, understand, consolidate and transfer new knowledge and skills. What to do with information opened to learners is opaque. I propose incorporating trace data about learning processes in learner models. Trace data allow generating learning analytics that inform self-regulating learners about potentially productive adaptations to processes they have used to learn. In a context of big data, such elaborated learner models are positioned to collaborate with self-regulating learners. Together, they can coordinate symbiotically, creating a platform for the system to improve its models of learners and for learners to more productively self-regulate learning. © 2020, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.",Learning analytics; Open learner models; Self-regulated learning; Trace data,Artificial intelligence; Learner model; Learning process; Model learning; Open learner models; Peer groups; Procedural knowledge; Process information; Research agenda; Learning systems
Using Data Analytic to Visualize Learning Style for Students TVET Polytechnic Malaysia,"Nowadays, with the emerging of rapid revolution industries, there are various educational learning styles evolve in solving the way of teaching and learning among the TVET polytechnic students. However, the surrounding changes of enormous data in learning styles have tangled the TVET polytechnic students to grab the opportunity to improve the performance of achievement in class. The study was conducted via a quantitative data survey with a total of 332 respondents gathered from several polytechnic Malaysia with engineering and non-engineering field of studies. The use of data analytics is considered as a relatively new area in TVET education in visualizing the pattern of learning styles that polytechnic students' required to use to, since TVET polytechnic students have a different background of academic level and courses. Thus, the findings of this study is to visualize the pattern of potential learning styles among TVET polytechnic students with different field studies.

Data-driven modeling of engagement analytics for quality blended learning,"Engagement analytics is a branch of learning analytics (LA) that focuses on student engagement, with most studies conducted by computer scientists. Thus, rather than focusing on learning, research in this field usually treats education as a scenario for algorithms optimization and it rarely concludes with implications for practice. While LA as a research field is reaching ten years, its contribution to our understanding of teaching and learning and its impact on learning enhancement are still underdeveloped. This paper argues that data-driven modeling of engagement analytics is helpful to assess student engagement and to promote reflections on the quality of teaching and learning. In this article, the authors a) introduce four key constructs (student engagement, learning analytics, engagement analytics, modeling and data-driven modeling); b) explain why data-driven modeling is chosen for engagement analytics and the limitations of using a predefined framework; c) discuss how to use engagement analytics to promote pedagogical reflection using a pilot study as a demonstration. As a final remark, the authors see the need of interdisciplinary collaboration on engagement analytics between computer science and educational science. In fact, this collaboration should enhance the use of machine learning and data mining methods to explore big data in education to provide effective insights for quality educational practice. © 2019, Italian e-Learning Association.

Towards open data in digital education platforms,"Despite the traction gained by the open data movement and the rise of big data and learning analytics in education, there is limited support for researchers in education to generate, access, and share experimental data using openly-available digital education platforms. To explore how this gap could be addressed and elicit requirements, we conducted a survey with 40 researchers in the field of technology-enhanced learning, examining their experience and needs handling research data. Drawing on the results of our survey, we devised a set of features that educational platforms should provide to address the identified requirements, enabling researchers in education to run studies within typical learning environments, adhere to legal and ethical frameworks concerning privacy, and share their data confidently with a wider audience. We then categorized these features into five stages that represent the user flow, namely (1) Bootstrapping Research Studies, (2) Ensuring Consent, (3) Gathering Data, (4) Managing Data Sets, and (5) Supporting Open Research and Collaboration. Our aim is to guide forthcoming research and developments to relieve researchers of the burdens of conducting data-sensitive experiments, support the adoption of best practices, and pave the way for open data policies in digital education. © 2019 IEEE.",Data management; Data sharing; Education; Learning analytics; Open data; Open research; Privacy,Computer aided instruction; Data privacy; E-learning; Education; Information management; Surveys; Best practices; Data Sharing; Educational platforms; Learning analytics; Learning environments; Research and development; Research studies; Technology enhanced learning; Open Data
What learning analytics tells us: Group behavior analysis and individual learning diagnosis based on long-term and large-scale data,"The practice and application of education data mining and learning analytics has become the focus of educational researchers. However, it is still a difficult task to explore the law of group learning and the characteristics of individual learning. In this study, the online learning logs of 1,088 students from 22 classes were analyzed from the aspects of their login behaviors, resource utilization, quizzes, interactive behaviors, and academic achievement. To address these issues, multiple methods, including statistical analysis, visualization social network analysis and correlation analysis, were used to analyze the process and results of online learning. The results reveal the characteristics of group behavior of online learners and highlight the key factors that influence the learning process and outcomes of individual learners. From the view of students, these factors include the length and allocation of online time, the effective utilization of resources, social interaction, online learning support and services, etc. From the perspective of teachers, the factors include the management of online teaching, the appropriateness of learning resources, the effectiveness of online intervention strategies, the accurate feedback for online learners, etc. Therefore, learning analysis technology can not only standardize the assessment of learning outcomes, but can also focus more attention on the standardization of learning process assessment. It also identifies the main factors that affect the online learning outcomes and the group characteristics of online learners. At the same time, it provides the learners with personalized learning diagnosis reports which can both help learners. © 2018, International Forum of Educational Technology and Society.",Educational big data; Learning analysis; Learning analytics; Learning diagnostic; Online learning,
Identifying at-risk students in online learning by analysing learning behaviour: A systematic review,"As the development of online learning is growing, a large amount of log data on student activity is available and accumulated in Learning Management Systems (LMS). This massive volume of data can be analysed in order to discover hidden information about students' learning behaviours and, in particular, to identify at-risk students and to advise instructors to provide additional assistance and interventions to help those who are at risk, to increase retention rates. As a result, Learning Analytics (LA) has emerged, which aims to measure, analyse and report students' learning behaviours using data analytics techniques. In this regard, this paper aims to provide an overview of how at-risk students are identified or predicted by analysing their learning behaviours in online learning, including the types of data and tools or analytics methods used. The findings indicate that most of the data analytics techniques have successfully identified and predicted at-risk students and various types of data are determined as attributes in predicting at-risk students. Finally, further research should be conducted to identify and predict at-risk students, since there are diverse students in online learning who have different demands, and interventions should be developed to tackle the problems faced by at-risk students in order to enhance their learning performances. © 2017 IEEE.",at-risk students; data analytics technique; learning analytics; log data; online learning,Big data; Information management; Online systems; Risk management; Students; Data analytics; Hidden information; Learning analytics; Learning management system; Learning performance; Log data; Online learning; Systematic Review; E-learning
Exploring the impact of Artificial Intelligence and robots on higher education through literature-based design fictions,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics are likely to have a significant long-term impact on higher education (HE). The scope of this impact is hard to grasp partly because the literature is siloed, as well as the changing meaning of the concepts themselves. But developments are surrounded by controversies in terms of what is technically possible, what is practical to implement and what is desirable, pedagogically or for the good of society. Design fictions that vividly imagine future scenarios of AI or robotics in use offer a means both to explain and query the technological possibilities. The paper describes the use of a wide-ranging narrative literature review to develop eight such design fictions that capture the range of potential use of AI and robots in learning, administration and research. They prompt wider discussion by instantiating such issues as how they might enable teaching of high order skills or change staff roles, as well as exploring the impact on human agency and the nature of datafication. © 2021, The Author(s).",AI; AIEd; Artificial Intelligence; Big data; Design fiction; Learning analytics; Robots; Social robots,
Does competency-based education with blockchain signal a new mission for universities?,"New technologies and the knowledge economy are destabilising graduate professions, with artificial intelligence and the analysis of ‘big data’ making significant impacts on formerly secure jobs. Blockchain technology, offering automated secure credentialling of undergraduate students’ activities and achievements, may significantly erode existing systems of assessment. The challenge for universities will be not only to maintain the relevance of their curricula but also to manage erosion of their current near-monopoly in awarding degrees. This paper envisions a landscape in which universities must outsource parts of their course delivery and assessment in order to remain competitive. It examines a potentially sustainable mission strategy: to move away from narrow academic disciplines towards an authentic learning curriculum focusing on the development of students as whole persons with rounded educations.

Engagement vs performance: Using electronic portfolios to predict first semester engineering student retention,"As providers of higher education begin to harness the power of big data analytics, one very fitting application for these new techniques is that of predicting student attrition. The ability to pinpoint students who might soon decide to drop out1 of a given academic program allows those in charge to not only understand the causes for this undesired outcome, but it also provides room for the development of early intervention systems. While making such inferences based on academic performance data alone is certainly possible, we claim that in many cases there is no substantial correlation between how well a student performs and his or her decision to withdraw. This is specially true when the overall set of students has a relatively similar academic performance. To address this issue, we derive measurements of engagement from students' electronic portfolios and show how these features can be effectively used to augment the quality of predictions.

Understanding online interaction in language MOOCs through learning analytics,"Data mining is increasing its popularity in the research of Technology-Enhanced Language Learning and Applied Linguistics in general. It enables a better understanding of progress, performance and possible pitfalls, which would be useful for language learners, teachers and researchers. Until recently it was an unexplored field, but it is expected to grow exponentially in the following years. This article attempts to be a relevant contribution as an instance of empirical research, showing the application of Learning Analytics to the Language MOOC (LMOOC) ‘How to succeed in the English B1 Level Exam.’ The focus or the research was threefold, trying to find out: (1) what types of learning objects students engage with most, (2) what aspects of online interaction relate more strongly to course completion and success, and (3) which are the most prominent student profiles in an LMOOC. Results show that short video-pills are the most powerful learning objects in this type of online courses, the regular submission of automated grading activities is a robust indicator towards course success, and the most prominent student profile in LMOOCs is ‘viewers’, those who access the learning materials but do not submit tasks or engage in online interaction actively, which would explain why the completion rate in LMOOCs is so low. This novel perspective into students’ language learning, which big data has assisted us in, should guide course creators to re-design the LMOOC for the enhancement of the audio-visual content. LMOOC instructors and facilitators should also encourage participants to increase the submission of activities –acknowledging these small achievements through micro-credentialing and badges-, and special attention ought to be paid to the most prominent LMOOC profile, those ‘viewers’ who should be lured into becoming ‘solvers’ or, even better, ‘all-rounders’. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",language MOOCs; learning analytics; LMOOCs; online interaction,
Using micro-patterns of speech to predict the correctness of answers to mathematics problems: An exercise in multimodal learning analytics,"Learning analytics techniques are traditionally used on the ""big data"" collected at the course or university level. The application of such techniques to the data sets generated in complex learning environments can provide insights into the relationships between the design of learning environments, the processes of learning, and learning outcomes. In this paper, two of the codes described as part of the Collaborative Process Analysis Coding Scheme (CPACS) were extracted from the Math Data Corpus. The codes selected were tense and pronouns, both of which have been found to indicate phases of group work and the action associated with collaboration. Rather than examine these measures of social interactions in isolation, a framework for the analysis of complex learning environments was applied. This facilitated an analysis of the relationships between the social interactions, the task design and learning outcomes, as well as tool use. The generation of a successful problem solution of one expert and one non-expert group was accurately predicted (75%-94%). The examination of interactions between the social, epistemic and tool elements of the learning environment for one group showed that successful role differentiation and participation were related to successful problem solutions in the first meeting. In the second meeting, these were less important. The relationship between the discourse related to problem resolution through action and the correctness of a problems solution was found to be less reliable measures, however further analysis is needed at a finer grain to investigate this finding.

"Rethinking assessment in a digital age: opportunities, challenges and risks","While it is frequently argued that assessment sits at the heart of the learning process, in practice assessment often remains narrowly focused on qualifications and reporting achievements, driven by institutional and societal aspirations and tensions such as accountability and economic well being. Yet, the need for assessment to account for the knowledge, skills, dispositions and attitudes necessary to equip young people for a changing and increasingly digital world is also increasingly acknowledged. Based on our recent research review, this article critically examines the role of technology enhanced assessment (or TEA). We argue that while technology offers many potentially creative opportunities for innovation and for rethinking assessment purposes, there are also numerous risks and challenges. In particular we highlight ethical concerns over social exclusion and new forms of digital dividedness and the increasing risks associated with big data and the rise of learning analytics. Finally, we note that much research and innovation happens in silos, where policy, research and practice on assessment, technology enhanced assessment and ethical and political concerns are not linked up. We conclude that there needs to be a much more wide-ranging, critical and nuanced discussion in educational and policy circles so that debates about the potential of technology can be linked to improving assessment in the light of the range of social and political challenges that such progress presents. We end with some critical questions for policy, practice and research communities, which we offer as a starting point for future thinking and ways forward. © 2015 British Educational Research Association",collaboration; digital literacies; e-assessment; ethics; formative/summative; inclusion; learning analytics,

Web-based learning and development of university's electronic informational educational environment,"Web-based learning has been developed by the majority of academic institutions and organizations worldwide due to its obvious benefits for both educators and learners. Meanwhile, many of the existing developmental approaches in this sphere lack one crucial consideration necessary for implementing web-based learning at academic institutions. In this article, the authors identify two processes: development of distance learning and digitalization of training that are represented now at almost every academic university. The article singles out the stages of their development and shows that the processes lead to the same result - a new quality of education. The authors focus on figuring out which path is more effective for achieving the highest level of development depending on university's characteristics. Accumulation of detailed information in the Electronic informational educational environment about current learning outcomes creates opportunities for emerging trends, such as Learning Analytics, Personalized Learning and Adaptive Learning.

Which first-year students are making most learning gains in stem subjects?,"With the introduction of the Teaching Excellence Framework a lot of attention is focussed on measuring learning gains. A vast body of research has found that individual student characteristics influence academic progression over time. This case-study aims to explore how advanced statistical techniques in combination with Big Data can be used to provide potentially new insights into how students are progressing over time, and in particular how students’ socio-demographics (i.e. gender, ethnicity, Social Economic Status, prior educational qualifications) influence students’ learning trajectories. Longitudinal academic performance data were sampled from 4222 first-year STEM students across nine modules and analysed using multi-level growth-curve modelling. There were significant differences between white and non-White students, and students with different prior educational qualifications. However, student-level characteristics accounted only for a small portion of variance. The majority of variance was explained by module-level characteristics and assessment level characteristics. © 2018 The Author(s).

Synergizing online group knowledge,"A huge amount of users' data are created on the Internet day by day. How to synergize those users' data to provide useful information will be an important issue. Based on the phenomenon mentioned above, this study aims to refine the users' data on an experimental social network platform named CoCoing.info to a reintegrated concept map. The CoCoing.info platform has been online for a half year. During the period, 646 users enrolled, and 2,096 concept maps and 4,569 users' responses were created. To synergize those users' data into a connected concept map for further value-added applications, two computer algorithms, term-generation and term-association programs, were designed to filter the users' data and to reintegrate the filtered data. By the term-generation algorithm, 46,490 terms were filtered. Moreover, the term-association algorithm synergized as an 18,011-node concept map based on the filtered terms. The synergized concept map can potentially provide users to implement adaptive value-added applications on it. © 2017 Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education.

Open learning platform based on personal and social analytics for individualized learning support,"With the help of several emerging computing paradigms, such as Ubiquitous Computing, Social Computing, and Mobile Computing, OLP (Open Learning Process) has become an important research issue in the online learning environment. It becomes possible to share the learning process related information in and cross systems to meet the needs of all stakeholders, such as teachers, learners and managers. In this study, we focus on the OLP in the social learning environment based on the personal and social analytics, which can provide users with the process-oriented learning support. We present a data processing framework to collect, analyze, and organize the learning-related data in a user-centric way. Three important issues regarding to the unified data management, socialized learning analytics, and sharable open learning process are discussed towards the process-oriented learning innovation. Based on these, an open learning platform is proposed and designed to provide users with the individualized support in the collaborative learning process. © 2015 IEEE.",Individualized learning support; Open learning process; Personal analysis; Social analysis; Social learning,Big data; Computer aided instruction; Data handling; E-learning; Information management; Internet; Online systems; Teaching; Trusted computing; Ubiquitous computing; Individualized learning; Open learning process; Personal analysis; Social analysis; Social learning; Learning systems
Advancing Agricultural Production With Machine Learning Analytics: Yield Determinants for California’s Almond Orchards,"Agricultural productivity is subject to various stressors, including abiotic and biotic threats, many of which are exacerbated by a changing climate, thereby affecting long-term sustainability. The productivity of tree crops such as almond orchards, is particularly complex. To understand and mitigate these threats requires a collection of multi-layer large data sets, and advanced analytics is also critical to integrate these highly heterogeneous datasets to generate insights about the key constraints on the yields at tree and field scales. Here we used a machine learning approach to investigate the determinants of almond yield variation in California’s almond orchards, based on a unique 10-year dataset of field measurements of light interception and almond yield along with meteorological data. We found that overall the maximum almond yield was highly dependent on light interception, e.g., with each one percent increase in light interception resulting in an increase of 57.9 lbs/acre in the potential yield. Light interception was highest for mature sites with higher long term mean spring incoming solar radiation (SRAD), and lowest for younger orchards when March maximum temperature was lower than 19°C. However, at any given level of light interception, actual yield often falls significantly below full yield potential, driven mostly by tree age, temperature profiles in June and winter, summer mean daily maximum vapor pressure deficit (VPDmax), and SRAD. Utilizing a full random forest model, 82% (±1%) of yield variation could be explained when using a sixfold cross validation, with a RMSE of 480 ± 9 lbs/acre. When excluding light interception from the predictors, overall orchard characteristics (such as age, location, and tree density) and inclusive meteorological variables could still explain 78% of yield variation. The model analysis also showed that warmer winter conditions often limited mature orchards from reaching maximum yield potential and summer VPDmax beyond 40 hPa significantly limited the yield. Our findings through the machine learning approach improved our understanding of the complex interaction between climate, canopy light interception, and almond nut production, and demonstrated a relatively robust predictability of almond yield. This will ultimately benefit data-driven climate adaptation and orchard nutrient management approaches. © Copyright © 2020 Jin, Chen, Lampinen and Brown.",artificial intelligence; big data; light interceptioon; nutrient management; Prunus dulcis; yield gap,
Trondheim revisited: From directory services to big data,"""A Directory Service contains information about organizations, services and, most important for this article, people. When a Directory contains personal data, the processing of this data, can conflict with a person's right to informational privacy. There are two EC directives concerning data protection, named SYN287 and SYN288. The SYN287 defines amongst others the circumstances under which processing of personal data is allowed. This article focusses on the matters of interest relevant when applying the rules to Directory Services. It describes why a balance has to be found between providing personal data in order to facilitate easy communication and withholding data because it concerns the privacy of the data subject."" The paragraphs above are part of the abstract that was submitted by us, exactly 25 years ago for the TNC predecessor JENC 1993 in Trondheim. Over the last 25 years, technology has transformed our services, our work and our lives in ways we could not have imagined in 1993. From local to the cloud. From limited data sets to (meta)data collected by services and social media we use every day. From a relative innocent phenomenon as Directory Services to big data and advanced data analysis. During this 25 years the concept of privacy was subject to debate. The unrestrained sharing of personal data on social media led to the statement that privacy is dead (and we better get used to it). Others approached privacy as a monetary transactional concept, or as primarily a contextual concept. In the past 25 years there were times with little or no interest in privacy, there were moments of glory (the Max Schrems court ruling) up to a lively privacy discussion today. Data protection law also evolved during the years. In an attempt to ensure our privacy the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016. From a EU legislative point of view one of the greatest achievements in recent years. With thanks to the Snowden revelations in 2013, that gave at a critical moment a push in the right - privacy protecting - direction. The Regulation replaces the Data Protection Directive we discussed in 1993 (adopted in 1995) which already aimed at a high standard of data protection but lacked the accountability and enforcement principles of the Regulation. In an attempt to keep up with the technical and social developments the GDPR requires transparency in automated decision-making systems, implementation of privacy by design principles and risks assessments. What we need to protect is no longer the relative static personal data stored in a database but our behavioural data, gathered from websites and applications. We need protection against incomprehensible and not transparent algorithms resulting in decisions that have an impact on our lives. We have to deal with the challenges related to mass-surveillance, big data, online behavioural advertising and cybersecurity. Within our community of Education and Research we see the impact of these developments. Of course we still have to deal with our online (Directory) Services with care, but the privacy challenges of the moment are completely different from those of 1993. Think of the data gathered for learning analytics, automatic decision making based on study application procedures or the combining of large datasets for research which takes away the anonymity of data and goes beyond initial defined purposes. Data protection principles and regulation alone are not sufficient to protect our privacy. Those principles were relatively easy to apply 25 years ago on Directory Services. Today's practice makes this a lot more challenging. If data minimisation is a principle, how to deal with the European Open Science Cloud and the resulting big data? If purpose limitation is a restriction how to deal with open data access and research combining sets of data without knowing beforehand which correlations or hypotheses can be found? The presentation discusses the development of the concept of privacy, the applicable rules and today's practice. If we take the protection of privacy seriously we should not treat it solely as a compliance issue. To answer the above questions, we need the discussion with and participation of the inventive and creative minds within the NREN community. © TNC 2018 - Intelligent Networks, Cool Edges.All right reserved.",Big data; Data protection; Data Protection regulation; Directory Service; Privacy principles,Behavioral research; Data Sharing; Decision making; Intelligent networks; Large dataset; Laws and legislation; Privacy by design; Social networking (online); Application procedures; Automated decision making systems; Data Protection Directive; Education and researches; General data protection regulations; Informational privacies; Protection of privacy; Protection principle; Open Data
Assisting Education through RealTime Learner Analytics,"Learning analytics has been dominating the education arena for these last few years as the efficacy and applicability of big data in general has been recognized, appreciated and fruitfully employed. Such analytics can assist and support higher education learners to optimize their interaction with available resources, while providing crucial insights on their learning behaviour and study processes. In this paper, we present a case study of how we employ an online environment with mature students within an ambient intelligent classroom. The specifically designed learning space makes use of a number of strategically positioned sensors that provide explicit data to the underlying intelligent system that forms part of the associated online portal. Physically present and remotely connected learners have access to their personalised learning environment that depends on their academic needs, progress, position in class, and the other learners in their group or vicinity. The ambient intelligent system coordinates the interaction between all the students and teacher who is present in class. A real-time machine learning application to detect learners' levels of attention and participation makes use of sensory data generated together with other learning data collected from the portal that collectively assists in the learning analysis process that is looped back to the learners' learning environment, as well as to the educator, in an attempt to improve the delivery and the entire educational process. We report on several issues encountered together with accuracy and reliability concerns as we draw a number of conclusions and offer recommendations. © 2018 IEEE.",Assessment visualisation; Aster plot; Elearning; Learning analytics; Online education platform,Ambient intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Sensory analysis; Students; Ambient intelligent; Ambient intelligent systems; Aster plot; Learning analytics; Learning environments; On-line education; Online environments; Personalised learning; E-learning
A social learning analytics approach to cognitive apprenticeship,"The need for graduates who are immediately prepared for employment has been widely advocated over the last decade to narrow the notorious gap between industry and higher education. Current instructional methods in formal higher education claim to deliver career-ready graduates, yet industry managers argue their imminent workforce needs are not completely met. From the candidates view, formal academic path is well defined through standard curricula, but their career path and supporting professional competencies are not confidently asserted. In this paper, we adopt a data analytics approach combined with contemporary social computing techniques to measure, instil, and track the development of professional competences of learners in higher education. We propose to augment higher-education systems with a virtual learning environment made-up of three major successive layers: (1) career readiness, to assert general professional dispositions, (2) career prediction to identify and nurture confidence in a targeted domain of employment, and (3) a career development process to raise the skills that are relevant to the predicted profession. We analyze self-declared career readiness data as well as standard individual learner profiles which include career interests and domain-related qualifications. Using these combinations of data sources, we categorize learners into Communities of Practice (CoPs), within which learners thrive collaboratively to build further their career readiness and assert their professional confidence. Towards these perspectives, we use a judicious clustering algorithm that utilizes a fuzzy-logic objective function which addresses issues pertaining to overlapping domains of career interests. Our proposed Fuzzy Pairwise-constraints K-Means (FCKM) algorithm is validated empirically using a two-dimensional synthetic dataset. The experimental results show improved performance of our clustering approach compared to baseline methods. © 2015, Abu Khousa et al.",Big data; Career readiness; Clustering; Community of practice; Computational science; Fuzzy logic; Learning analytics; Social networks,
A machine learning model on virtual university of senegal’s educational data based on lambda architecture.,"Nowadays, a new form of learning has emerged in higher education. This is e-Learning. Lessons are taught on a Learning Content Management Systems (LCMS). These platforms generate a large variety of data at very high speed. This massive data comes from the interactions between the system and the users and between the users themselves (Learners, Tutors, Teachers, administrative Agents). Since 2013, UVS (Virtual University of Senegal), a digital university that offers distance learning through Moodle and Blackboard Collaborate platforms, has emerged. In terms of statistics, it has 29340 students, more than 400 active Tutors and 1000 courses. As a result, a large volume of data is generated on its learning platforms. In this article, we have set up an architecture allowing us to execute all types of queries on all data from platforms (historical data and real-time data) in order to set up intelligent systems capable of improving learning in this university. We then set up a machine learning model as a use case which is based on multiple regression in order to predict the most influential learning objects on the learners’ final mark according to his learning activities. © 2020 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science (IAES).

Utilizing student time series behaviour in learning management systems for early prediction of course performance,"Predictive analytics in higher education has become increasingly popular in recent years with the growing availability of educational big data. Particularly, a wealth of student activity data is available from learning management systems (LMSs) in most academic institutions. However, previous investigations into predictive analytics in higher education using LMS activity data did not adequatelyaccommodate student behaviours in the form of time series. In this study, we have applied a deep learning approach — long short-term memory (LSTM) networks — to analyze student online temporal behaviours using their LMS data for the early prediction of course performance. To reveal the potential of the deep learning approach in predictive analytics, we compared LSTM networks with eight conventional machine-learning classifiers in terms of the prediction performance as measured by the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) scores. Results indicate that using the deep learning approach, time series information about click frequencies successfully provided early detection of at-risk students with moderate prediction accuracy. In addition, the deep learning approach showed higher prediction performance and stronger generalizability than the machine learning classifiers. © 2020, UTS ePRESS.

Towards developing an effective algorithm visualization tool for online learning,"Although many Algorithm Visualization (AV) tools are available online, most of them are not effective in helping students to learn algorithm and data structures. The reasons for this may be the poor design consideration of the tools to fulfill the learners' needs in terms of pedagogy, usability, and accessibility. This paper reports a work-in-progress research project at Athabasca University on developing an effective algorithm visualization tool for online learning. We analyze the pedagogy, usability, and accessibility goals and their respective features for the online learners and examines how the visualization and user interaction principals can help to achieve these goals in the design process of an effective AV tool. We present a review of the related literature to highlight current and past researches and illustrate the need for better user experience design in AV tools. We then identify the online learners' needs and the context of their activities to design a usable, useful, effective, and pleasurable interactive AV tool. Such a tool can fulfill the pedagogy, usability, and accessibility goals for the online learners. © 2018 IEEE.",Algorithm visualization; Interaction design; Learning analytics; Online learning; Students' engagement,Big data; Data visualization; Learning algorithms; Smart city; Trusted computing; Ubiquitous computing; User interfaces; Visualization; Algorithm visualization; Interaction design; Learning analytics; Online learning; Students' engagements; E-learning
Hybrid Analysis of Audience Gaze and Constitutive Features of Slides for Extracting the Defective Portions from Presentation Slides,"The need for training students in presentation skills has been proposed. Skills in the creation, elaboration of slides are particularly important but it is actually difficult to train students in such skills. It is important for students to properly understand defective portions in slides so that they can polish the slides by themselves. However, it is difficult for novices to detect defective portions, it generally depends on individual work by experienced people such as professors. Such work imposes a huge burden on professors, prevents detailed guidance including the linkage of oral explanations, gestures, slide descriptions. This research was aimed at developing a mechanism for extracting the defective portions in slides, providing them to students on the basis of hybrid analysis of two promising sources: (1) constitutive features being inherent in the slide data, (2) audiences' visual tracking behaviors of slide content. This paper mainly describes methods of extracting candidates for problems from presentation slides that inhibit understanding by audiences on the basis of constitutive features of slides, audience gaze. © 2016 IEEE.",Audience gaze; Defective portion in presentation slides; Learning analytics; Slide constitutive feature; Slide elaboration support,Education; Personnel training; Students; Trusted computing; Ubiquitous computing; Audience gaze; Experienced people; Learning analytics; Oral explanations; Presentation skills; Presentation slides; Slide constitutive feature; Training students; Big data
Opinion mining from student feedback data using supervised learning algorithms,"This paper explores opinion mining using supervised learning algorithms to find the polarity of the student feedback based on pre-defined features of teaching and learning. The study conducted involves the application of a combination of machine learning and natural language processing techniques on student feedback data gathered from module evaluation survey results of Middle East College, Oman. In addition to providing a step by step explanation of the process of implementation of opinion mining from student comments using the open source data analytics tool Rapid Miner, this paper also presents a comparative performance study of the algorithms like SVM, Naïve Bayes, K Nearest Neighbor and Neural Network classifier. The data set extracted from the survey is subjected to data preprocessing which is then used to train the algorithms for binomial classification. The trained models are also capable of predicting the polarity of the student comments based on extracted features like examination, teaching etc. The results are compared to find the better performance with respect to various evaluation criteria for the different algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.",Learning Analytics; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Opinion mining; Rapid Miner; Sentiment analysis; Supervised learning; Text Analytics,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Data mining; Learning systems; Miners; Natural language processing systems; Nearest neighbor search; Students; Supervised learning; Surveys; Learning Analytics; NAtural language processing; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Text analytics; Learning algorithms
"Digital education governance: data visualization, predictive analytics, and ‘real-time’ policy instruments","Educational institutions and governing practices are increasingly augmented with digital database technologies that function as new kinds of policy instruments. This article surveys and maps the landscape of digital policy instrumentation in education and provides two detailed case studies of new digital data systems. The Learning Curve is a massive online data bank, produced by Pearson Education, which deploys highly sophisticated digital interactive data visualizations to construct knowledge about education systems. The second case considers ‘learning analytics’ platforms that enable the tracking and predicting of students’ performances through their digital data traces. These digital policy instruments are evidence of how digital database instruments and infrastructures are now at the centre of efforts to know, govern and manage education both nationally and globally. The governing of education, augmented by techniques of digital education governance, is being distributed and displaced to new digitized ‘centres of calculation’, such as Pearson and Knewton, with the technical expertise to calculate and visualize the data, plus the predictive analytics capacities to anticipate and pre-empt educational futures. As part of a data-driven style of governing, these emerging digital policy instruments prefigure the emergence of ‘real-time’ and ‘future-tense’ techniques of digital education governance. © 2015 The Author(s).

EAGER adopters in education: Strategic plan ideas for integrating instructional technology,"Strategic plans for teaching and learning are essential, however, they tend to focus on moving a mass of stakeholders along an agreeable path. The strategy is necessary and sensible, although many times, these plans miss a key audience important to the future of education, the eager adopters. Previously, this group was called ""early adopters"", however, I believe that the time in which educators become involved is not as important as their eagerness. This philosophy follows Thoreau's notion that, ""If a man loses pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer."" It is those, who hear different drummers that may appear to be tangent to institutional missions, although they may actually be leading initiatives, which the institution may eventually adopt. Some of the eager ideas which will be shared in this paper include Social Emotional Competency, Digital Content Creation Ecosystems, MOOCs, play with purpose maker economy fabrication labs, Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, big data learning analytics, wearable technology, the quantifiable self, the internet of things, and mobile learning.

Raspberry PI and role of IoT in Education,"In this era of high and fast-moving technology, students are more demanding and willing to use innovative learning methods, also, they will be Seeing forward to living and surviving in the new environment of a smart classroom. This subject gives a framework to clarify how it can be utilized to institute a smart and innovative university campus life to improve the delivery and efficiency of everyday activities with consideration of the social and environmental interactions, and hence provide not only a smart but likewise, a sustainable campus. The use of the internet of things (IOT) is able to exchange and make use of information for students' participation and interaction with the class fellows and teachers in a very suitable way. For the educational assessment of a student's interaction, the measurement of student attentiveness is an indispensable component of it. The need for a high method for assessment also arises in the development of new technology in the mode of a new style of learning.

Systematic Literature Review of E-Learning Capabilities to Enhance Organizational Learning,"E-learning systems are receiving ever increasing attention in academia, business and public administration. Major crises, like the pandemic, highlight the tremendous importance of the appropriate development of e-learning systems and its adoption and processes in organizations. Managers and employees who need efficient forms of training and learning flow within organizations do not have to gather in one place at the same time or to travel far away to attend courses. Contemporary affordances of e-learning systems allow users to perform different jobs or tasks for training courses according to their own scheduling, as well as to collaborate and share knowledge and experiences that result in rich learning flows within organizations. The purpose of this article is to provide a systematic review of empirical studies at the intersection of e-learning and organizational learning in order to summarize the current findings and guide future research. Forty-seven peer-reviewed articles were collected from a systematic literature search and analyzed based on a categorization of their main elements. This survey identifies five major directions of the research on the confluence of e-learning and organizational learning during the last decade.

Education as a domain of natural data extraction: analysing corporate discourse about educational tracking,"Digital platforms and learning analytics are becoming increasingly widespread in the education sector: commercial corporations argue their benefits for teaching and learning, thereby endorsing the continuous automated collection and processing of student data for measurement, assessment, management, and identity formation. Largely missing in these discourses, however, are the potential costs of datafication for pupils’ and teachers’ agency and the meaning of education itself. This article explores the general discursive framing by which these surveillant practices in education have come to seem natural. Through a study of commercial suppliers of educational platforms, we show how the prevailing vision of datafication in their discourses categorises software systems, not teachers, as central to education, reimagining space, time, and agency within educational processes around the organisation of data systems and the demands of commercial data production. Not only does this legitimate the new connective environment of dataveillance (that is, surveillance through data processing), but it also naturalises a wider normative environment in which teachers and students are assigned new roles and responsibilities. In the process, the panoptic possibilities of ubiquitous commercial access to personal educational data are presented as part of a virtuous circle of knowledge production and even training for good citizenship. This broader rethinking of education through surveillance must itself be critiqued. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Big data; data collection; datafication; dataveillance; surveillance,
Mining activity log data to predict student's outcome in a course,"Use of learning management system (LMS) is very common, which provide support to teaching staff for communication, delivery of resources and in design of learning activities. The wide spread use of technologies like LMS, provide large amount of data. Research shows that higher education institutes can make use of this data to extract data-driven insights to understand the learning process and benefit the students by supporting them in their academics. In this study we used several machine learning algorithms to predict student's outcome in a course using LMS trace data and assessment scores. Selection of the courses is based on the extent the LMS is used and is divided into two categories; distance and internal. This study confirms the importance of LMS data and assessment scores in the prediction of academic performance. However, frequent use of LMS may increase the trace data but it is not necessary improve the predictive accuracy. Predictive models developed for courses, without considering the context of use of LMS data, may not generalize the effects of LMS trace data on student's outcome in the course. © 2019 ACM.",Classification; Education data mining; Learning analytics; Prediction,Big data; Classification (of information); Education computing; Forecasting; Human resource management; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Students; Academic performance; Higher education; Learning Activity; Learning analytics; Learning management system; Mining activities; Predictive accuracy; Predictive models; Data mining
GAN-based pencil drawing learning system for art education on large-scale image datasets with learning analytics,"We design a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based pencil drawing learning system for art education on large image datasets to help students study how to draw pencil drawings for images and scenes. The system generates a pencil drawing result for a natural image based on GAN. The GAN network is trained on pencil drawing big datasets containing image pairs of natural images and their corresponding pencil drawings. Using the pencil drawing learning system, students can paint pencil drawings whenever they want and for whatever they like by uploading an image of the content they want to draw and getting a pencil drawing example of the uploaded image from the system. With the returned pencil drawing, students will see the pencil drawing effect of natural scenes clearly and realize how to draw the pencil drawing for the natural scene. Besides, with students using the pencil drawing learning system, it will be convenient for teachers assigning homework to students. Teachers can know the learning demands of students by evaluating the hand-in homework and update the content correspondingly. We have conducted two user studies for evaluating the practicality of the system, and the result of the two user studies demonstrated the applicability and practicality of the system. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",art education; GAN; learning analytic; pencil drawing big data; Pencil drawing learning system,
Visual analytics of video-clickstream data and prediction of learners' performance using deep learning models in MOOCs' courses,"The big data stored in massive open online course (MOOC) platforms have become a posed challenge in the Learning Analytics field to analyze the learning behavior of learners, and predict their respective performance, related especially to video lecture data, since most learners view the same online lecture videos. This helps to conduct a comprehensive analysis of such behaviors and explore various learning patterns in MOOC video interactions. This paper aims at presenting a visual analysis, which enables course instructors and education experts to analyze clickstream data that were generated by learner interaction with course videos. It also aims at predicting learner performance, which is a vital decision-making problem, by addressing their issues and improving the educational process. This paper uses a long short-term memory network (LSTM) on implicit features extracted from video-clickstreams data to predict learners' performance and enable instructors to make measures for timely intervention. Results show that the accuracy rate of the proposed model is 89%–95% throughout course weeks. The proposed LSTM model outperforms baseline Deep learning (GRU) and simple recurrent neural network by accuracy of 90.30% in the “Mining of Massive Datasets” course, and the “Automata Theory” accuracy is 89%. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",deep learning (LSTM); MOOCs courses; prediction; video-clickstream; visual analytics,Decision making; Forecasting; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Comprehensive analysis; Decision-making problem; Education experts; Educational process; Learner interaction; Massive open online course; Simple recurrent neural networks; Video interactions; Deep learning
Evaluation of key performance indicators (Kpis) for sustainable postgraduate medical training: An opportunity for implementing an innovative approach to advance the quality of training programs at the saudi commission for health specialties (scfhs),"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is undergoing a major transformation in response to a revolutionary vision of 2030, given that healthcare reform is one of the top priorities. With the objective of improving healthcare and allied professional performance in the Kingdom to meet the international standards, the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) has recently developed a strategic plan that focuses on expanding training programs’ capacity to align with the increasing demand for the country’s healthcare workforce, providing comprehensive quality assurance and control to ensure training programs uphold high quality standards, and providing advanced training programs benchmarked against international standards. In this research paper, we describe our attempt for developing a general framework for key performance indicators (KPIs) and the related metrics, with the aim of contributing to developing new strategies for better medical training compatible with the future. We present the results of a survey conducted in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), for the enhancement of quality of postgraduate medical training. The recent developments in the field of learning analytics present an opportunity for utilizing big data and artificial intelligence in the design and implementation of socio-technical systems with significant potential social impact. We summarize the key aspects of the Training Quality Assurance Initiative and suggest a new approach for designing a new data and services ecosystem for personalized health professionals training in the KSA. The study also contributes to the theoretical knowledge on the integration of sustainability and medical training and education by proposing a framework that can enhance future initiatives from various health organizations. © 2020 by the authors.

Relational event models for social learning in MOOCs,"We propose three extensions for the relational event framework to model the co-evolution of multiple network event streams which are increasingly available thanks to the explosive growth of online applications. Firstly, a flexible stratification approach is considered to allow for more complex data structures with many types of nodes and events. Secondly, an inference method that combines nested case-control sampling with stratification is discussed to scale the approach to very large data sets. Finally, a suite of new temporal and network statistics is introduced to reflect the potentially complex dependencies among events and observed heterogeneities on nodes and edges.The empirical value of new extensions is demonstrated through an analysis of social learning in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In particular, three modeling problems are considered from the network perspective: (1) the utility of social factors, performance indicators, and clickstream behaviors in the prediction of course dropout, (2) the social and temporal structure of learner interactions across discussion threads, and (3) the forms of mutual dependence of social learning interactions on prior learning success, and future learning success on forms of prior social learning interaction. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",MOOCs; Relational event models; Social learning analytics,
Disrupting and democratising higher education provision or entrenching academic elitism: towards a model of MOOCs adoption at African universities,"Challenges of broadening access, escalating cost, maintaining desirable quality and enhancing meaningful learning experiences in African higher education (HE) have spurred debates on how to restructure higher education delivery to meet the diverse needs of heterogeneous learners and adapt pedagogical models to the educational realities of low-income African countries. In view of these complexities, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been advanced by Western Consortia, universities and online platform providers as panaceas for disrupting/transforming existing education models African universities. MOOCs have been touted as disruptive innovations with the potential to create new niche markets for HE courses, disrupt traditional models of instruction and content delivery and create new revenue streams for higher education. Yet academic elitism which manifests in the exclusive selection of top American universities to develop, host and deliver MOOCs, MOOC providers’ use of university brand and reputation as benchmarks for charging recruitment fees on headhunters recruiting MOOC graduates and their complex business models involving the sale of students’ big data (e.g. learning analytics) for profit seem to be inconsistent with claims about philanthropic and egalitarian drive of MOOCs. Drawing on disruptive innovation theory and a review of mainstream literature on MOOCs adoption in American and African tertiary sectors, this study argues that behind the MOOC rhetoric of disrupting and democratizing higher education lies the projection of top academic brands on the marketing pedestal, financial piggybacking on the hype and politics of academic exclusion. © 2016, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.",Academic elitism; Democratisation; Disruptive innovation theory; MOOCs,
Model for the collection and analysis of data from teachers and students supported by academic analytics,"Academic Analytics enables an analysis of data that is very important for making decisions in the educational institutional environment, aggregating valuable information in the academic research activity and providing easy to use business intelligence tools. This article shows a proposal for creating an information system based on Academic Analytics, designing a model that is supported by Academic Analytics for the collection and analysis of data from the information systems of educational institutions. The idea that was conceived proposes a system that is capable of displaying statistics on the historical data of students and teachers taken over academic periods, with the purpose of gathering the information that the director, the teacher, and finally the student need for making decisions. The model was validated with information taken from students and teachers during the last five years, and the export format of the data was pdf, csv, and xls files. The findings allow us to state that it is extremely important to analyze the data that is in the information systems of the educational institutions for making decisions. After the validation of the model, it was established that it is a must for students to know the reports of their academic performance in order to carry out a process of self-evaluation, as well as for teachers to be able to see the results of the data obtained in order to carry out processes of self-evaluation, and adaptation of content and dynamics in the classrooms. © 2020 The Authors.

A machine-learning approach to assess aircraft engine system performance,"Machine learning and big data have become the most disruptive technologies for organizations to improve workplace efficiency and productivity. This work explored the application of machine learning-based predictive analytics that would enable aircraft engine designers to estimate engine system performance quickly during the conceptual design stage. Supervised machine-learning algorithm was employed to study patterns in an open-source database of one-hundred-eighty-three production and research turbofan engines, and built predictive analytics for use in predicting system performance of new turbofan designs. Specifically, the author developed deep-learning analytics to predict turbofan system weight, using turbofan design parameters as the input. The predictive analytics were trained and deployed in Keras, an open-source neural networks API (application program interface) written in Python, with TensorFlow (an open-source Google machine learning library) serving as the backend engine. The current engine-weight prediction results, together with those for the TSFC (thrust specific fuel consumption) and core-size predictions that were studied previously by the author, show that machine learning-based predictive analytics can be an effective, time-saving tool for assessing aircraft engine system performance (TSFC, weight, and core size) during the conceptual design stage. It would enable expeditious identification of the best engine design amongst several candidates. © 2020 ASME",Aircraft engine; Deep learning; Python; TensorFlow,Aircraft engines; Aircraft manufacture; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Conceptual design; Deep learning; Engines; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine design; Open systems; Predictive analytics; Supervised learning; Turbofan engines; Turbomachinery; Turing machines; Vehicle performance; Application program interfaces; Conceptual design stages; Disruptive technology; Machine learning approaches; Open source database; Supervised machine learning; Thrust specific fuel consumption; Turbofan design; Learning algorithms
"An automated framework to recommend a suitable academic program, course and instructor","In this paper we propose a recommendation tool framework to help a student pick the right program, right course and right instructor that fit his/her skills and characteristics. We apply collaborative filtering (CK), using a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method, to extract latent features corresponding to the student academic skills and to the program required skills: when augmented with a student's competence level, the required skills of programs can be exploited to produce a program recommender system. Then using a multi-objective optimization method, we propose a degree plan recommender system that is able to design a customized/personalized degree plan that will better fit to real life situations by moving the courses with relatively higher crucial values and higher predicted letter grades to closest possible terms while meeting all the constraints. We extend our framework to include instructor recommender system. The intuition is to recommend an instructor that jointly fits the required skills of the course and the academic skills of the student. The experimental results conducted using real data from the University of New Mexico (UNM) show that our proposed framework can accurately extract features related to students and courses. The results are validated using k-means clustering technique. Ultimately, using this framework, we will be able improve enrollment, help students graduate in a timely fashion and incentive their ability to persist. © 2019 IEEE.",Collaborative filtering; Education and learning; Learning analytics; Recommender system,Big data; Collaborative filtering; Curricula; Factorization; Fluid mechanics; K-means clustering; Matrix algebra; Multiobjective optimization; Shore protection; Students; Water resources; Academic program; K-means clustering techniques; Learning analytics; Nonnegative matrix factorization; University of New Mexico; Recommender systems
Social network analysis to influence career development,"Social network analysis techniques have shown a potential for influencing graduates to meet industry needs. In this paper, we propose a social-web driven solutions to bridge formal education and industry needs. The proposed career development framework utilizes social network analytics, influence diffusion algorithms and persuasive technology models along three phases: (1) career readiness to measure and visualize the general cognitive dispositions required for a successful career in the 21st Century, (2) career prediction to persuade future graduates into a desired career path by clustering learners whose career prospects are deemed similar, into a community of practice; and (3) career development to drive growth within a social network structure where social network analytics and persuasive techniques are applied to incite the adoption of desired career behaviors. The process starts by discovering behavioral features to create a cognitive profile and diagnose individual deficiencies. Then, we develop a fuzzy clustering algorithm that predicts similar patterns with controlled constraint-violations to construct a social structure for collaborative cognitive attainment. This social framework facilitates the deployment of novel influence diffusion approaches, whereby we propose a reciprocal-weighted similarity function and a triadic closure approach. In doing so, we investigate contemporary social network analytics to maximize influence diffusion across a synthesized social network. The outcome of this social computing approach leads to a persuasive model that supports behavioral changes and developments. The performance results obtained from both analytical and experimental evaluations validate our data-driven strategy for persuasive behavioral change. © 2017, The Author(s).",Big data; Community of practice; Computational science; Fuzzy logic; Learning analytics; Social web,Big data; Clustering algorithms; Diffusion; Digital storage; Employment; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy logic; Program processors; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Cognitive dispositions; Community of practice; Computational science; Experimental evaluation; Learning analytics; Persuasive technology; Social network structures; Social webs; Economic and social effects
Technology-enhanced learning and co-operative practice against the neoliberal university,"ABSTRACT: Neoliberalism is a global pedagogical project aimed at the dispossession of free time so that all of life becomes productive, and education is a central institutional means for its realisation. This project aims at marketising all of social life, so that life becomes predicated upon the extraction of value. In part the deployment of technologies, technical services, and techniques enables education to be co-opted as an institutional means for production and control. This occurs inside both formal and informal educational institutions and spaces, like universities and Massive Open On-line Courses, as one mechanism to offset the tendency for the rate of profit to fall and to re-establish accumulation. This pedagogic project also tends to recalibrate and enclose the roles of staff and students as entrepreneurial subjects, whose labour is enabled through technology. This is achieved through learning analytics, big data, mobility and flexibility of provision, and so on. At issue is the extent to which this neoliberal project can be resisted or refused, and alternatives described. This article will analyse the relationships between technology, pedagogy, and the critical subject in the neoliberal University, in order to argue for the use of technology inside a co-operative pedagogy of struggle. This demands that we ask what education is, before we ask what it is for, or the place of technology-enhanced learning in the university. The article considers whether it is possible to uncover ways in which education might be used for co-operation rather than competition, and what technology-enhanced co-operative education might look like? © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Co-operation; higher education; neoliberalism; technology-enhanced learning; university,
Enabling visual community learning analytics with Internet of Things devices,"Industry 4.0 is currently transforming industrial workplaces into sensor-assisted high-tech environments. While it is often feared that jobs will be lost through increasing automation, we are convinced that there is an enormous potential for versatile and competent workers at innovative workplaces. Training at the workplace may contribute to this. In this context, both body-near wearables and industrial devices produce an enormous amount of data. However, the question is how to deal with this amount of data. To this end, visual analytics is a combination of computational techniques from data mining and machine learning with human perceptional methods from human-computer interaction. In this article we present a method and tool support to create rich and interactive visual analytics charts to analyze innovative training solutions in high-tech workplace settings. This brings together the computer's capacities to handle large data and calculation resources with the human ability to quickly grasp relationships. Our technical evaluation shows, that the approach is feasible from a computational perspective; usability tests revealed that the developed pipeline metaphor reaches its goal. Our results may help in designing future systems that fulfill the needs of both trainers and learners in Industry 4.0 settings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Community of practice; Internet of Things; Visual analytics,Data mining; Human computer interaction; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Visualization; Community learning; Community of practice; Computational technique; Industrial devices; Technical evaluation; Training solutions; Usability tests; Visual analytics; Learning systems
Analyzing Learners Behavior in MOOCs: An Examination of Performance and Motivation Using a Data-Driven Approach,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have been experiencing increasing use and popularity in highly ranked universities in recent years. The opportunity of accessing high quality courseware content within such platforms, while eliminating the burden of educational, financial, and geographical obstacles has led to a rapid growth in participant numbers. The increasing number and diversity of participating learners has opened up new horizons to the research community for the investigation of effective learning environments. Learning Analytics has been used to investigate the impact of engagement on student performance. However, the extensive literature review indicates that there is little research on the impact of MOOCs, particularly in analyzing the link between behavioral engagement and motivation as predictors of learning outcomes. In this paper, we consider a dataset, which originates from online courses provided by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, delivered through the edX platform. Two sets of empirical experiments are conducted using both statistical and machine learning techniques. Statistical methods are used to examine the association between engagement level and performance, including the consideration of learner educational backgrounds. The results indicate a significant gap between success and failure outcome learner groups, where successful learners are found to read and watch course material to a higher degree. Machine learning algorithms are used to automatically detect learners who are lacking in motivation at an early time in the course, thus providing instructors with insight in regards to student withdrawal. © 2013 IEEE.",big data; Machine learning; massive open online courses; statistical analysis,Artificial intelligence; Bibliographies; Big data; Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Education; Education computing; Hidden Markov models; Job analysis; Learning algorithms; Motivation; Statistical methods; Students; Tools; Data-driven approach; Discussion forum; Effective Learning Environment; Empirical experiments; Machine learning techniques; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Massive open online course; Task analysis; Learning systems
Identifying online learners' requirements for an efficient feedback and support system,"In distance education learners are encouraged to be autonomous learners by learning at their own place and pace. However, they require relevant supports and timely feedback to motivate them progress effectively in their studies. In absence of face to face interactions, tutors are unable to understand clearly the problems faced by the learners and thus they are not given the right timely feedback. This research is part of a doctoral research and the aim of this paper is to firstly, investigate the types of supports that learners look for in a completely online course and secondly, identify a convenient environment to enable tutors track the learners' progress and give personalized assistance. As methodology, a content analysis of four synchronous tutorial chats, of 998 lines of interactions, was done based on activity theory of Engestrom. An online tutor and his ten learners participated in the chats, enabling them to interact freely with the focus of successfully completing the assignment set. Result depicts the human behaviour of learners enrolled in a completely online course: they queried on the rules, the procedures of the course as well as on the expectations of the tutor. The interactions were focused towards meeting the objectives of the course but they were not dominated by meta-cognitive interactions. Thus, we propose for relevant variables to be logged to enable tutors to understand learner's progress and to give efficient support based on the analysis of learning analytics of learners' past interactions. Learners' behaviours via their interactions, will enable tutors identify lurkers, active and passive learners. This research is a stepping stone in identifying patterns with regards to tutors and learners' interactions. © 2015 IEEE.",activity theory; content analysis; interactions; learning analytic; online support,Activity coefficients; Beam plasma interactions; Behavioral research; Big data; Distance education; E-learning; Teaching; Activity Theory; Autonomous learners; Content analysis; Doctoral research; Face-to-face interaction; Human behaviours; learning analytic; Online support; Learning systems
The Evolution of Research on Digital Education,"How does AI&EdAIED today compare to 25 years ago? This paper addresses this evolution by identifying six trends. The trends are ongoing and will influence learning technologies going forward. First, the physicality of interactions and the physical space of the learner became genuine components of digital education. The frontier between the digital and the physical has faded out. Similarly, the opposition between individual and social views on cognition has been subsumed by integrated learning scenarios, which means that AIED pays more attention today to social interactions than it did at its outset. Another trend is the processing of learners' behavioural particles, which do not carry very many semantics when considered individually, but are predictive of knowledge states when large data sets are processed with machine learning methods. The development of probabilistic models and the integration of crowdsourcing methods has produced another trend: the design of learning environments has become less deterministic than before. The notion of learning environment evolved from a rather closed box to an open ecosystem in which multiple components are distributed over multiple platforms and where multiple stakeholders interact. Among these stakeholders, it is important to notice that teachers play a more important role than before: they interact not only at the design phase (authoring) but also in the runtime phase (orchestration). These trends are not specific to AIED; they depict the evolution of learning technologies as a whole. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.",Digital Education; Learning Analytics; MOOCs,Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Education; Engineering education; Learning systems; Semantics; Teaching; Learning Analytics; Learning environments; Learning technology; Machine learning methods; MOOCs; Multiple components; Multiple stakeholders; Probabilistic models; E-learning
Advanced learning analytics in academic education: Academic performance forecasting based on an artificial neural network,"The integration of innovative data mining and decision-making techniques in the context of higher education is a bold initiative towards enhanced performance. Predictive and descriptive analytics add interesting insights for significant aspects the education. The purpose of this article is to summarize a novel approach for the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques towards forecasting of academic performance. The added value of applying AI techniques for advanced decision making in education is the realization that the scientific approach to standard problems in academia, like the enhancement of academic performance is feasible. For the purpose of this research the authors promote a research in Saudi Arabia. The vision of the Knowledge Society in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a critical milestone towards digital transformation. The human capital and the integration of industry and academia has to be based on holistic approaches to skills and competencies management. One of the main objectives of an academic decision maker is to ensure that academic resources are adequately planned and that students are properly advised. To achieve such an objective, an extensive analysis of large volumes of data may be required. This research develops a decision support system (DSS) that is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) model that can be deployed for effective academic planning and advising. The system is based on evaluating academic metrics against academic performance for students. The model integrates inputs from relevant academic data sources into an autonomous ANN. A simulation of real data on an ANN is conducted to validate the system's accuracy. Moreover, an ANN is compared with different mathematical approaches. The system enables the quality assurance of planning, advising, and the monitoring of academic decisions. The overall contribution of this work is a novel approach to the deployment of Artificial Intelligent for advanced decision making in higher education. In future work this model is integrated with big data and analytics research for advanced visualizations.

Data Mining Approach for Determining Student Attention Pattern,"This Research Full Paper presents the approach of traditional engineering analysis techniques on education. Data mining techniques have been successfully employed to extract hidden information from large data sets within various contexts. We hypothesized that data mining techniques can similarly be applied to large educational data sets to extract and analyze patterns and create insights. Specifically, we examined the degree to which standard data mining techniques can distinguish between different student attention patterns in large lectures in which personal computers were actively used. Our data set consists of electronically captured student attention data (on-task, off-task) that was recorded at 20 second intervals throughout each course lecture over one semester. With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, methods involved capturing student data via a backend monitoring system to reduce student awareness of monitoring and reduce false behavior changes during data collection periods. The data were originally captured in the form of images (screenshots), and image processing techniques were applied to extract student attention patterns in the form of zero (off-task) and one (on-task). We conducted descriptive statistical analysis to add other features such as characterization information (e.g., total logged in attention, average class period attention to the recorded data sets). For the data mining analysis, we used three different supervised machine learning classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classifying the students' dataset. We classified the students into one of four different classes based on their attention pattern in the lecture class. Before applying each classification algorithm, feature extraction was performed. For this purpose, we used Haar wavelets, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) dimensionality-reduction techniques before applying the classification algorithm. Their performance is compared. Our results indicate high classification accuracies can be obtained using these dimensional reduction algorithms followed by classification algorithms. Our result highlights the importance of applying traditional engineering analysis techniques to educational data in order to provide engineering education insights. © 2020 IEEE.",Data mining; Decision tree; KNN; learning analytics; SVM,Decision trees; Dimensionality reduction; Discriminant analysis; Engineering education; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Monitoring; Nearest neighbor search; Personal computers; Students; Support vector machines; Trees (mathematics); Classification algorithm; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Image processing technique; Institutional review boards; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Linear discriminant analysis; Supervised machine learning; Traditional engineerings; Data mining
Algorithms for the Development of Deep Learning Models for Classification and Prediction of Behaviour in MOOCS.,"MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are definitely one of the best approach to support the international agenda about inclusive and equitable education and lifelong learning opportunities for all (SDG4) [1]. A great deal universities and institutions offer valuable free courses to their numerous students and to people around the word through MOOC platforms. However, because of huge number of learners and data generated, learner's behaviour in those platforms remain a kind of black box for learners themselves and for courses instructors who are supposed to tutor or monitor learners in the learning process. Therefore, learner do not receive sufficient support from instructors and from their peers, during the learning process [2]. This is one the main reasons that lead to high dropout, low completion and success rate observed in the MOOCs. Many research work have suggested descriptive, predictive and prescriptive models to address this issue, but most of these models focus on predicting dropout, completion and/or success, and do not generally pay enough attention to one of the key step (learner behaviour), that comes before, and can explain dropping out and failure. Our research aims to develop a deep learning model to predict learner behaviour (learner interactions) in the learning process, in order to equip learners and course instructors with insight understanding of the learner behaviour in the learning process. This specific paper will focus on analysing relevant algorithms to develop such model. For this analysis, we used data from UNESCO-IICBA (International Institute for Capacity Building in Africa) MOOC platform, designed for teacher training in Africa, and then we examine many types of features: geographical, social behavioural and learning behavioural features. Learner's behaviour being a time series Big data, we built the predictive model using Deep Learning algorithms for better performance and accuracy (Thanks to the power of deep learning) compared to baseline Machine learning algorithms. Time series data is best handled by recurrent neural networks (RNN) [3], so, we choose RNN and implemented/tested the three main architectures of RNN: Simple RNNs, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) RNNs and LSTM (Long short-term memory) RNNs. The models were trained using L2 Regularization, based on the predictions results, we unexpectedly found model with simple RNNs produced the best performance and accuracy on the dataset used than the other RNN architectures. We had couple of observations, example: we saw a correlation between video viewing and quiz behaviour and the participation of the learner to the learning process. This observation could allow teachers to provide meaningful support and guidance to at risk or less active students. We also observed that, the shorter the video or the quiz, the more the viewer. We conclude that we could use learner video or quiz viewing behaviour to predict his behaviour concerning other MOOC contents. These results suggest the need of deeper research on educational video and educational quiz designing for MOOCs. © 2020 IEEE.",Deep learning; e-learning; Education; Learner Behaviour; Learning Analytics; Machine learning; MOOC; Recurrent Neural Network,Curricula; Deep learning; Distance education; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Network architecture; Personnel training; Predictive analytics; Students; Teaching; Time series; Baseline machines; Educational videos; Learner interaction; Life long learning; Massive open online course; Predictive modeling; Prescriptive models; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Learning algorithms
"Demographic effects on student-reported satisfaction with teams and teammates in a first-year, team-based, problem-based course","This work-in-progress reports the effect of student gender and team gender make-up on team satisfaction and student assessments of team contributions. In first year team-based student design courses, instructors use student self- and peer-assessment information to gauge team functioning and even to affect student project scores. However, students' identity characteristics, such as their gender and race, may impact the scores they receive from others as well as the scores they assign. The poster will also describe the creation of and results from a learning-analytics style investigation of the researcher's own student team assessment data, and the poster presentation will allow others to query the data set with their own questions. The final data set includes assessment information from 620 first-year engineering students working in 132 teams of 4 or 5 to design, build, test, and report in varying open-ended project contexts (from 11 sections of the course taught between Fall 2011 and Winter 2015). The study is presented as a poster because the researcher is eager to connect with others at ASEE to consider new questions of interest. The data set includes demographic data (gender, race, TOEFL score when applicable, SAT/ACT scores, first year GPA, final course grade), as well as team assessments (student self-assessments and assessments of teammates, team report scores, and team satisfaction ratings). In this large data set, many comparisons were significant. Findings of interest regarding team satisfaction included a pattern of satisfaction by team gender breakdown. Teams with two or more women were much less happy (mean satisfaction of 3.79 on a 5-pt scale) compared to students on teams of just men (4.25) and teams with one woman (4.32). This finding is in contrast to a recommendation common in the literature to avoid stranding women on teams. Teams that included international students were less happy (mean satisfaction of 3.68) compared to teams that did not (4.24). Both of these patterns had medium-sized effect sizes (Cohen's d was 0.67 for the finding by gender and 0.74 for the finding with international students.) There was no difference in the mean satisfaction of students on teams including or not including under-represented minority students (4.16 for teams with URM students, 4.17 for teams without). Student ratings of peers were examined by gender. CATME asks students to rate each other on five scales for behaviors related to teamwork. The largest effect was found for ""having related knowledge, skills, and abilities."" Women were rated lower on this category (by both men and women), and men rated women lower on this category than women rated women (Cohen's d was 0.69 here). Women were rated higher than men on all other categories (by both men and women), but with much smaller effect sizes (Cohen's d ranging from 0.12 to 0.32). This project is proposed as a work-in-progress because there are many limitations related to using my own data for this study. This exploratory study of existing data has uncovered interesting patterns in students' assessments of team satisfaction and contributions that should be investigated further, perhaps through follow-up interviews or through an experimental design. I look forward to talking with conference attendees and getting input before moving forward with such a study. I am also eager to have conversations about what the findings might suggest for how teams are formed and, more importantly, how they are supported and assessed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.",,
