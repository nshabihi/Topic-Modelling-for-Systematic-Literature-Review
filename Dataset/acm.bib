Big data of education is an important means of modernization educational change based on data acquisition and analysis technology. The major applications of big data in education are educational data mining, learning analysis and educational decision-making and so on [1]. With the combination of big data and education, adaptive learning system [2] gradually into our sight. Adaptive learning system is a system that can provide a personalized learning service for learners. The system can recommended personalized learning path and learning resources according to learners' various characteristics and behavioral tendencies, such as learning style, media tendency, interest, cognitive level and so on. This paper aims to design an adaptive learning system based on the big data in education. The system contains four modules: domain module, student module, adaptive recommendation module and visual display module.},

abstract = {Higher education institutions are at this stage, on the one hand, faced with challenges never seen before and, on the other hand, their action is moving very rapidly into digital learning spaces. These challenges are increasingly complex because of the global competition for resources, students and teachers. In addition, the amount of data produced inside and outside higher education institutions has grown exponentially, so more and more institutions are exploring the potential of Big Data to meet these challenges. In this context, higher education institutions and key stakeholders (students, teachers, and governance) can derive multiple benefits from learning analytics using different data analysis strategies to produce summative, real-time and predictive information and recommendations. However, it may be questioned whether institutions, academic administrative staff as well as including those with responsibility for governance, are prepared for learning analytics? As a response to the question raised in this paper is presented an extension of a disruptive conceptual approach to higher education, using information gathered by IoT and based on Big Data &amp; Cloud Computing and Learning Analytics analysis tools, with the main focus on the stakeholder governance.},

Vendors incorporate analytics practices, models, and algorithms from datamining, business intelligence, and the emerging "big data" fields. Researchers, in contrast, have built up a substantial base of techniques for analyzing discourse, social networks, sentiments, predictive models, and in semantic content (i.e., "intelligent" curriculum). In spite of the currently limited knowledge exchange and dialogue between researchers, vendors, and practitioners, existing learning analytics implementations indicate significant potential for generating novel insight into learning and vital educational practices. This paper presents an integrated and holistic vision for advancing learning analytics as a research discipline and a domain of practices. Potential areas of collaboration and overlap are presented with the intent of increasing the impact of analytics on teaching, learning, and the education system.},

New, because the tools used to achieve this goal, like Big Data and natural language processing, were not feasible merely 10 years ago. Leuven is also the home of beautiful centuries old buildings filled with young, smart and active students. In Learning Analytics, we can also find established researchers in the fields of Educational Research and Technology-Enhanced Learning, collaborating with a large contingent of new and promising researchers that could be called Learning Data Scientists.},

The theme of LAK15, Scaling Up: Big Data to Big Impact, reflects our growing community of researchers, practitioners, and learners and our success in leveraging the power of "big data" to create substantial impact within higher education and learning at increasingly larger scales, while simultaneously reflecting the need for analytics to be effective at the level of individual learning (n of 1). Building on the momentum generated in earlier conferences and in recognition of our growth and of our mission 'inventing effective means to improve the way students learn', we have introduced a practitioner track this year. We hope that addressing and discussing the learning from two points of view; that of the researcher/learner and the practitioner, will provide each of us some impulse to think diversely about the many stakeholders in learning analytics and to open new perspectives on the intersection between research and the practice.},

abstract = {Learning analytics is an emerging field of research, which deals with collecting and analysing data about learners and their learning context, as well as developing solutions that utilise the analysed data. Traditionally, learning analytics methods focus on the analysis of learners' digital trails or numerical big data, e.g., online material access, digital learners' records, grades, and length of interaction with the learning environment. However, profiling a learner without taking into account the emotional aspects that may hinder the learner's progress, can only offer an incomplete view of the learning experience. Hence, in this paper, we elaborate on the fusion of emotional aspects (i.e., emotion data) and learning analytics, specifically in online learning settings. We bring an open discussion to the educational technology community regarding the potential of analysing learner's emotions from pedagogical texts (i.e., non-structured text data) generated during an online course. We also discuss the role of negative emotions during learning, the ethical issues with the use of emotion data and the technology acceptance and reliability.},

The increasing presence of solutions based on big data has even questioned the validity of current scientific methods. Is this going to happen in the area of learning analytics? In this paper we postulate that if changes are driven solely by a digital footprint, there is a risk of focusing only on factors that are directly connected to numeric methods. However, if the changes are complemented with an understanding about how students approach their learning, the quality of the evidence used in the redesign is significantly increased. This reasoning is illustrated with a case study in which an initial set of activities for a first year engineering course were shaped based only on the student's digital footprint. These activities were significantly modified after collecting qualitative data about the students approach to learning. We conclude the paper arguing that the interpretation of the meaning of learning analytics is improved when combined with qualitative data which reveals how and why students engaged with the learning tasks in qualitatively different ways, which together provide a more informed basis for designing learning activities.},

abstract = {The development of Big Data applications in education has drawn much attention in the last few years due to the enormous benefits it brings to improving teaching and learning. The integration of these Big Data applications in education generates massive data that put new demands to available processing technologies of data and extraction of useful information. Primarily, several higher educational institutions depend on the knowledge mined from these vast volumes of data to optimise the teaching and learning environment. However, Big Data in the higher education context has relied on traditional data techniques and platforms that are less efficient. This paper, therefore, conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that examines Big Data framework technologies in higher education outlining gaps that need a solution in Big Educational Data Analytics. We achieved this by summarising the current knowledge on the topic and recommend areas where educational institutions could focus on exploring the potential of Big Data Analytics. To this end, we reviewed 55 related articles out of 1543 selected from Six (6) accessible Computer Science databases between the period of 2007 and 2018, focusing on the development of the Big Data framework and its applicability in education for academic purposes. Our results show that very few researchers have tried to address the integrative use of Big Data framework and learning analytics in higher education. The review further suggests that there is an emerging best practice in applying Big Data Analytics to improve teaching and learning. However, this information does not appear to have been thoroughly examined in higher education. Hence, there is the need for a complete investigation to come up with comprehensive Big Data frameworks that build effective learning systems for instructors, learners, course designers and educational administrators.},

abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) refers to the use of suitable data mining methods and tools to discover knowledge from educational big data to help improve the quality of education, such as determining the priority learning needs of different student groups, increasing graduation rates, effectively evaluating the performance of the institution, and maximizing the use of campus resources and optimizing the update of subject courses. In this paper, we propose a grade prediction method to help university students choose courses reasonably. First of all, using big data analysis techniques, we can obtain the relationship between the performance of all students and course selection in recent years, and discover the influence of different course selection orders. Then, based on the current academic performance of a single student, the method can predict the impact of different elective courses for that student. Since students need to improve their future grade scores, predicting their performance will remind students to understand their performance and provide opportunities for their future performance. This method provides decision-making support for students' choices and enables them to choose courses reasonably to improve grades. This method also provides a foundation for university curriculum programs and reduces the number of dropouts. The data set for this study comes from the Student Information System of the Sokoine University of Agricultural (SUASIS), which includes data on student performance during academic activities.},

Quoted in a July 2017 article from HigherEd.com, "Georgia State's extensive predictive analytics efforts are leading to better grades and student retention -- and more minorities graduating from STEM programs.'' This doctoral project builds upon current data mining and modeling, machine learning applications, and learning analytics for predicting student success that is beyond retention. Gaining knowledge of CS student learning, developing better alerting models for success, and discovering behavioral indicators from learning analytics reporting is the goal of this research. Using this knowledge as evidence based data for improving the CS student experience will aid in performance improvements and increase pathways to graduation. My supporting research project is building CS student datasets to represent the student as directed graphical models, investigating their relationships using machine learning frameworks, and complex mathematical computations (tensors or gradient boosting) along with graph data mining techniques.},

abstract = {Today's organizations, including online businesses, use the art of data-driven decision-making i.e. business-intelligence (BI) to benefit from all the data out in the open. Given the current market demand for BI skill-sets, including the knowledge of different sources and tools for data-collection plus processing, today's youth need a basic understanding of data-driven intelligence, and an awareness of big-data related ethics and privacy. However, there has been limited research and development work towards designing an effective educational module in this regard at the K-12 level. We intend to address this particular limitation by presenting a uniquely engaging middle-school learning module based upon a combination of useful topics, like data-mining, predictive-analytics, data-visualization, big-data, ethics and privacy, using the free RapidMiner software-tool. The novelty of our module lies in the use of a GUI-based visual hands-on platform (RapidMiner), a Hollywood movie-theme based educational activity, as well as an added focus on big-data ethics and privacy, and its conceptual mapping to the NSA-GenCyber security-first principles. We discuss and analyze the survey data obtained from over hundred participants through several offerings of our module as an educational workshop through our Google-IgniteCS and NSA-GenCyber programs. The collected learning-analytics data indicate that our module can become a simple yet effective means for introducing data-mining, big-data, ethical and privacy issues, and GenCyber security-first principles at the middle-school level. Our results show prospects of motivating middle-school participants towards further learning of topics in data-science, data-ethics and data-security, which is necessary today in a variety of professions.},

A description of the curriculum and the underlying pedagogical framework is followed by a discussion of the challenges to be tackled as part of this integration. We also include examples of data visualization based on real student and teacher data. With more than one million students and fifty thousand teachers using the curriculum, a massive and rich dataset is continuously updated. This repository depicts teacher and students usage of an inquiry-based science program, and offers exciting opportunities to leverage research to improve both teaching and learning. The growing dataset, with more than a hundred million items of activity in six months, also poses technical challenges such as data storage, complex aggregation and analysis with broader implications for pedagogy, big data, and learning.},

abstract = {The avalanche of data of many types generated at high speed proposes nowadays a new scenario nominated Big Data. These data generated by many types of systems, such as commercial systems, financial systems, and even systems involving areas such as healthcare and education need to be analyzed to favor decision making. In this sense, specific techniques and technologies can be used together to establish Analytics, a special term used for data analysis. Generally called Analytics, specifications such as Business Analytics, Learning Analytics, or Academic Analytics can be identified. In this way, this research addresses the relationship between the concepts of Academic Analytics and a specific model for the management and operation of digital solutions in the educational area called eQETIC. Analyzing the practices proposed by the model and the concepts, it is possible to identify, in a non-quantitative way, that the model favors the activities of data management and data analysis; consequently it is also favor the implementation of Academic Analytics.},

abstract = {The big data revolution is an exciting opportunity for universities, which typically have rich and complex digital data on their learners. It has motivated many universities around the world to invest in the development and implementation of learning analytics dashboards (LADs). These dashboards commonly make use of interactive visualisation widgets to assist educators in understanding and making informed decisions about the learning process. A common operation in analytical dashboards is a 'drill-down', which in an educational setting allows users to explore the behaviour of sub-populations of learners by progressively adding filters. Nevertheless, drill-down challenges exist, which hamper the most effective use of the data, especially by users without a formal background in data analysis. Accordingly, in this paper, we address this problem by proposing an approach that recommends insightful drill-downs to LAD users. We present results from an application of our proposed approach using an existing LAD. A set of insightful drill-down criteria from a course with 875 students are explored and discussed.},

abstract = {This work provides an overview of an education and technology monitoring system developed at Plan Ceibal, a nationwide initiative created to enable technology enhanced learning in Uruguay. Plan Ceibal currently offers one-to-one access to technology and connectivity to every student and teacher (from primary and secondary education) as well as a comprehensive set of educational software platforms. All these resources generate massive amounts of data about the progress and style of students learning. This work introduces the conceptual framework, design and preliminary results of the Big Data Center for learning analytics currently being developed at Plan Ceibal. This initiative is focused on exploiting these datasets and conducting advanced analytics to support the educational system. To this aim, a 360 degrees profile will be built including information characterizing the user's online behavior as well as a set of technology enhanced learning factors. These profiles will be studied both at user (e.g., student or teacher) and larger scale levels (e.g., per school or school system), addressing both the need of understanding how technology is being used for learning as well as to provide accurate feedback to support evidence based educational policies.},

abstract = {Higher Education is facing disruptive innovation that requires, among other things, provision of a more effective and customized education service to individual students. In the field of Learning Analytics (LA), there has been much effort, in the form of the collection and thorough analysis of a variety of student-related datasets, to optimize learning performance and environments by means of personalization. The datasets include traditional questionnaire surveys, learning management system (LMS) log data of learner activities, and, more recently in the wake of the big-data-analytics trend, unstructured datasets such as SNS activities, text data, and other transactional data. Spatial data, however, is rarely considered as a key dataset, despite its high potential for characterization of students and prediction of their performances and conditions. In this context, the authors propose a new, spatial-data-driven student-characterization research framework. This vision paper describes spatial computing in its three, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive modeling stages as well as its three challenges: (1) technical spatial data acquisition issues; (2) legal and administrative issues; (3) expansion of the application domains in which spatial data can contribute to improved modeling quality. With respect to each challenge, the on-going efforts are briefly introduced in order to substantiate the feasibility of the proposed research framework.},

abstract = {Educational practitioners and policy makers require evidence supporting claims about educational efficacy. Evidence is often found using causal relationships between education inputs and student learning outcomes. Causal inference covers a wide range of topics in education research, including efficacy studies to prove if a new policy, software, curriculum or intervention is effective in improving student learning outcomes. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are considered a gold standard method to demonstrate causality. However, these studies are expensive, timely and costly, as well as not being ethical to conduct in many educational contexts. Causality can also be deducted purely from observational data. In this tutorial, we will review methodologies for estimating the causal effects of education inputs on student learning outcomes using observational data. This is an inherently complex task due to many hidden variables and their interrelationships in educational research. In this tutorial, we discuss causal inference in the context of educational research with big data. This is the first tutorial of its kind at Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK) that provides a hands-on experience with Python and Apache Spark as a practical tool for educational researchers to conduct causal inference. As a prerequisite, attendees are required to have familiarity with Python.},

abstract = {Research has shown that the cheat sheet preparation process helps students with performance in exams. However, results have been inconclusive in determining the most effective guiding principles in creating and using cheat sheets. The traditional method of collecting and annotating cheat sheets is time consuming and exhaustive, and fails to capture students' preparation process. This work examines the development and impacts of a new web-based study preparation tool, Study Genie, supporting collaborative note creation, editing, sharing, and cheat sheet organization. This new educational technology enables big-data learning analytics, permitting quantitative data modeling on connecting formal and informal digital learning footprints. Study Genie also systematically automates cheat-sheet quality evaluation, which traditionally could only have been done qualitatively. A classroom study was conducted to measure the technology and learning effects in an introductory computer science programming course. Results suggest that actions associated with editing and organizing cheat sheets are positively correlated with exam performance, and that there is a significant difference between the activity of high-performing and low-performing students. Through these results, Study Genie presents itself as an opportunity for mass data collection, providing insight into the assembly process rather than just the finished product in cheat sheet creation.},

abstract = {Learning analytics techniques are traditionally used on the "big data" collected at the course or university level. The application of such techniques to the data sets generated in complex learning environments can provide insights into the relationships between the design of learning environments, the processes of learning, and learning outcomes. In this paper, two of the codes described as part of the Collaborative Process Analysis Coding Scheme (CPACS) were extracted from the Math Data Corpus. The codes selected were tense and pronouns, both of which have been found to indicate phases of group work and the action associated with collaboration. Rather than examine these measures of social interactions in isolation, a framework for the analysis of complex learning environments was applied. This facilitated an analysis of the relationships between the social interactions, the task design and learning outcomes, as well as tool use. The generation of a successful problem solution of one expert and one non-expert group was accurately predicted (75%-94%). The examination of interactions between the social, epistemic and tool elements of the learning environment for one group showed that successful role differentiation and participation were related to successful problem solutions in the first meeting. In the second meeting, these were less important. The relationship between the discourse related to problem resolution through action and the correctness of a problems solution was found to be less reliable measures, however further analysis is needed at a finer grain to investigate this finding. A rich description of the processes of learning (with regards to social interaction, generation of knowledge, and discourse related to action) was generated for one group.},
