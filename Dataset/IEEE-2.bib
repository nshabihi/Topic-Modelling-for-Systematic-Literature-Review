abstract={Despite the traction gained by the open data movement and the rise of big data and learning analytics in education, there is limited support for researchers in education to generate, access, and share experimental data using openly-available digital education platforms. To explore how this gap could be addressed and elicit requirements, we conducted a survey with 40 researchers in the field of technology-enhanced learning, examining their experience and needs handling research data. Drawing on the results of our survey, we devised a set of features that educational platforms should provide to address the identified requirements, enabling researchers in education to run studies within typical learning environments, adhere to legal and ethical frameworks concerning privacy, and share their data confidently with a wider audience. We then categorized these features into five stages that represent the user flow, namely (1) Bootstrapping Research Studies, (2) Ensuring Consent, (3) Gathering Data, (4) Managing Data Sets, and (5) Supporting Open Research and Collaboration. Our aim is to guide forthcoming research and developments to relieve researchers of the burdens of conducting data-sensitive experiments, support the adoption of best practices, and pave the way for open data policies in digital education.},

abstract={21st Century education develops professional competencies such as lifelong learning, critical thinking and creativity. Learning analytics (LA) and Big Data approaches are emerging to discover readiness patterns of higher education learners towards embracing these competences. To supplement formal education into building these career-oriented habits, a portal application is proposed by feeding data streams gathered from learners throughout their higher-education lifetime, into an analytics engine that reveals levels of professional competencies achievement and tells learners how to increase their career readiness. Big Data techniques are used to gather and cluster data streams, whereas LA techniques examine these data to derive levels of career readiness, which guide higher education learners into a successful career path. The proposed methodology starts by defining and validating standard career disposition criteria inspired from education psychology literature. These intangible disposition indicators and other career-oriented data are stored in a data warehouse for further aggregation and analysis, to evaluate similarities among career patterns and to cluster individuals whose career prospects are deemed similar, into a community of practice (CoP). We synthesize this novel online social structure as a result of the proposed portal processes to augment formal education with a virtual learning environment. This informal classroom-like structure is supervised by a professional mentor to bridge diverse viewpoints and instill a joint effort to leverage future workforce developments. CoP also provides indicators and means to intervene in order to positively affect career readiness.},

abstract={It is found that learners prefer to use micro learning mode to conduct learning activities through open educational resources (OERs). However, adaptive micro learning is scarcely supported by current OER platforms. In this paper we focus on profiling an effective micro learning process which is central to establish the raw materials and set up rules for the final adaptive process. This work consists of two parts. First, we conducted an educational data mining and learning analysis study to discover the patterns and rules in micro learning through OER. Then based on its findings, we profiled features of both learners and OERs to reveal the full learning story in order to support the decision making process. Incorporating educational data mining and learning analysis, an cloud-based architecture for Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS) was designed to integrate all necessary procedures together as a complete service for delivering micro OERs. The MLaaS also provides a platform for resource sharing and exchanging in peer-to-peer learning environment. Working principle of a key step, namely the computational decision-making of micro OER adaptation, was also introduced.},

abstract={An enduring issue in higher education is student retention to successful graduation. To further this goal, we develop a system for the task of predicting students' course grades for the next enrollment term in a traditional university setting. Each term, students enroll in a limited number of courses and earn grades in the range A-F for each course. Given historical grade data, our task is to predict the grades for each student in the courses they will enroll in during the next term. With this problem formulation, the next-term student grade prediction problem becomes quite similar to a rating prediction or next-basket recommendation problem. The factorization machine (FM), a general-purpose matrix factorization (MF) algorithm suitable for this task, is leveraged as the state-of-the-art method and compared to a variety of other methods. Our experiments show that FMs achieve the lowest prediction error. Results for both cold-start and non-cold-start prediction demonstrate that FMs can be used to accurately predict in both settings. Finally, we identify limitations observed in FMs and the other models tested and discuss directions for future work. To our knowledge, this is the first study that applies state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms to solve the next-term student grade prediction problem.},

abstract={In recent years, leveraging big data technology to education domain draws attention. The retention rate of student on campus may be significantly improved if an early alert system based on data analysis is setup and the intervention is appropriately deployed. However, to the best of our knowledge, the existing proposed early alert systems take the whole participants in a group or one single class as analysis target. In this paper, we compare different strategies and methods that deal with the whole participants and groups in different classes to identify the key attributes to improve the accuracy of the proposed early alert systems. Our results in this study indicate that teachers in different classes may make use of different functionality of LMS. Different data volumes are collected in different classes. A robust early alert predictive model needs to take the above into consideration.},

abstract={Many educational institutions enforce attendance policies, where students are expected to have their absences below a certain percentage in each class. Attendance records are collected to enforce such policies, but they are rarely utilized for anything else. In this paper, we investigate the value of analyzing the records pulled from student attendance systems. We apply a data mining technique, the market basket analysis, on student attendance data. The contribution of this analysis is the identification of student groups who share highly similar absence records. Such similarity may indicate that the students are missing classes due to peer pressure, rather than valid excuses. The presented method helps instructors and advisors discover this behavior, which is more efficient than relying on instructors, who may teach many classes. To minimize the number of false alarms, student groups are ranked based on their absence similarity. We tested our method by analyzing student attendance data for over two thousand students for one semester at a public higher education institution.

abstract={In this paper, we present our preliminary results of identifying serendipitous findings from discussion forums of students by using a text-mining analytical tool to predict their academic performances. The analytical results were visualized by constructing KeyGraphs so that teachers can assess the effectiveness of teaching and innovation of learning respectively through the visualization of hidden patterns in the online learning environment. Our results show that the serendipitous findings have shown a traceable pattern, which is statistically significant to predict the academic performance of students. The research findings can lead to adaptive pedagogical designs for teaching and learning by finding hidden patterns and linkages among the students' serendipitous learning. The identified results are expected to support both teachers and students on how to improve teaching and learning with feedbacks from this new tool. Ultimately, this creates a new approach for transformative learning and teaching in education by using the advanced mining technology to assess the students' knowledge discovery process.},

abstract={The prediction of academic performance is one of the most important tasks in educational data mining, and has been widely studied in MOOCs and intelligent tutoring systems. Academic performance could be affected with factors like personality, skills, social environment, the use of library books and so on. However, it is still less investigated that how could the use of library books affect academic performance of college students and even leverage book-loan history for predicting academic performance. To this end, we propose a supervised content-aware matrix factorization for mutual reinforcement of academic performance prediction and library book recommendation. This model not only addresses the sparsity challenge by explainable dimension reduction techniques, but also promotes library book recommendation by recommending "right" books for students based on their performance levels and book meta information. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model on three years of the book-loan history and cumulative grade point average of 13,047 undergraduate students in one university. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the competing baselines on both tasks, and that academic performance is not only predictable from the book-loan history but also improves the recommendation of library books for students.},

abstract={The research goal was set to determine to what extent the influences of learning analytics and academic analytics, the antecedent factors in predicting student academic achievement through the use of big data were. There has been no discussion on progress, success, retention, or decline of this achievement. Therefore, this research has significance for the improvement of higher education institutions. The research was in the form of online surveys involving 203 respondents, i.e., leaders, structural staff, and academic advisors from each of these institutions in Pontianak. Tests of eight hypotheses were conducted through SEM-PLS Method, and two of them had no direct influences. The results show that the two antecedent factors, directly and indirectly, have different influences and significance values on student academic achievement prediction despite the critical roles of big data. In addition, results obtained through the application of learning analytics and academic analytics in relation to big data of higher education institutions, especially for the need to predict student academic achievement, are infrequently similar.},

abstract={The current shift from traditional classrooms to online learning in higher education calls for more attention to self-regulated learning. This research is motivated by the growing interest in potential of using learning analytics dashboard (LAD) to increase individuals' self-regulation by creating visibility into their performance in various applications. This study explores how data visualization can be integrated with online learning to improve learners' performance through enhancing their skills in planning and organization. We are working on the design of a comprehensive LAD, focusing on micro-level of learning analytics to support learning activities of students. The LAD includes the following two features to enhance students' self-regulation in online learning: (1) a function to track students' progress compared to other students' over time; (2) reminders to help students with upcoming deadlines and auto-generating to do lists. The hypothesis is that the LAD will increase students' engagement, motivation, and self-regulation in an online learning environment. This study is significant because it contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring how student-generated data can be used to improve self-regulated learning. The practical contribution of this study is to create a personalized LAD for students based on the learner-generated data to benefit students' organization skill, planning skill, and motivation.},

abstract={In this paper we propose a recommendation tool framework to help a student pick the right program, right course and right instructor that fit his/her skills and characteristics. We apply collaborative filtering (CK), using a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method, to extract latent features corresponding to the student academic skills and to the program required skills: when augmented with a student's competence level, the required skills of programs can be exploited to produce a program recommender system. Then using a multi-objective optimization method, we propose a degree plan recommender system that is able to design a customized/personalized degree plan that will better fit to real life situations by moving the courses with relatively higher crucial values and higher predicted letter grades to closest possible terms while meeting all the constraints. We extend our framework to include instructor recommender system. The intuition is to recommend an instructor that jointly fits the required skills of the course and the academic skills of the student. The experimental results conducted using real data from the University of New Mexico (UNM) show that our proposed framework can accurately extract features related to students and courses. The results are validated using k-means clustering technique. Ultimately, using this framework, we will be able improve enrollment, help students graduate in a timely fashion and incentive their ability to persist.},

abstract={As the development of online learning is growing, a large amount of log data on student activity is available and accumulated in Learning Management Systems (LMS). This massive volume of data can be analysed in order to discover hidden information about students' learning behaviours and, in particular, to identify at-risk students and to advise instructors to provide additional assistance and interventions to help those who are at risk, to increase retention rates. As a result, Learning Analytics (LA) has emerged, which aims to measure, analyse and report students' learning behaviours using data analytics techniques. In this regard, this paper aims to provide an overview of how at-risk students are identified or predicted by analysing their learning behaviours in online learning, including the types of data and tools or analytics methods used. The findings indicate that most of the data analytics techniques have successfully identified and predicted at-risk students and various types of data are determined as attributes in predicting at-risk students. Finally, further research should be conducted to identify and predict at-risk students, since there are diverse students in online learning who have different demands, and interventions should be developed to tackle the problems faced by at-risk students in order to enhance their learning performances.},

The study reveals that while the examined universities seem to recognize and appreciate the new analytics functions available within learning management systems, they seem to struggle with forming a consistent and effective approach to link those functions to improve the decision-making process. Most popular analytics functions include analytics concerned with curriculum coverage, goal performance, student performance, and early alert systems at the course and degree program levels.},

abstract={Designing an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that simulates human learning with regard to different knowledge levels is a challenge as it reflects an accurate way of estimating the students‚Äô performance level. Most developed ITSs typically focus on the normal cognitive factors such as the students‚Äô prior success and failure scores without paying appropriate consideration to the sensitive cognitive factors that have a great impact on the student performance prediction such as the integration of the human current skills and given items skills, particularly when the learning items require multiple skills, which thus reduce student‚Äôs learning efficiency due to an incomplete representation of the student‚Äôs knowledge. This paper presents a modified student modeling approach, called modified Performance Factor Analysis (ModPFA), based on a previously developed model called Performance Factor Analyses (PFA). ModPFA was developed by adding the hinting parameter to the original PFA formula. This extension has scoring procedure and knowledge level estimation for each student. Results have shown great improvement in terms of performance estimation in the ModPFA compared to PFA.},

abstract={Learning analytics has been dominating the education arena for these last few years as the efficacy and applicability of big data in general has been recognized, appreciated and fruitfully employed. Such analytics can assist and support higher education learners to optimize their interaction with available resources, while providing crucial insights on their learning behaviour and study processes. In this paper, we present a case study of how we employ an online environment with mature students within an ambient intelligent classroom. The specifically designed learning space makes use of a number of strategically positioned sensors that provide explicit data to the underlying intelligent system that forms part of the associated online portal. Physically present and remotely connected learners have access to their personalised learning environment that depends on their academic needs, progress, position in class, and the other learners in their group or vicinity. The ambient intelligent system coordinates the interaction between all the students and teacher who is present in class. A real-time machine learning application to detect learners' levels of attention and participation makes use of sensory data generated together with other learning data collected from the portal that collectively assists in the learning analysis process that is looped back to the learners' learning environment, as well as to the educator, in an attempt to improve the delivery and the entire educational process. We report on several issues encountered together with accuracy and reliability concerns as we draw a number of conclusions and offer recommendations.},

abstract={The teaching and learning methods are increasingly adopting educational data mining approaches. This ever-changing landscape has allowed management to use educational data for strategic decision-making, offered students with relevant information to improve academic performance, and provided teachers with data on learners' behavior for effective teaching. To assess academically at-risk students, teachers need to gain valuable insights on student engagement, which includes class attendance, library and computer laboratory access, and use of other learning resources so that they can tailor the learning needs of students. Data analytics is used to examine student engagement inside and outside the classroom and predict learning trends. The popularity of Internet of Things and the convergence of RFID, Wireless Sensor Networks, Big Data, and Cloud Computing have enabled organizations to implement innovative information systems; however, their integrative potential has not been thoroughly explored. Having an RFID in combination with data analytics will provide various academic stakeholders valuable and critical information as regards students' learning behavior. Therefore, this paper reviews current trends of RFID in education and discusses opportunities of data analytics integration. Moreover, this paper also presents a conceptual framework of a basic RFID Analytic System that can be used in assessing student engagement.},

abstract={MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are definitely one of the best approach to support the international agenda about inclusive and equitable education and lifelong learning opportunities for all (SDG4) [1]. A great deal universities and institutions offer valuable free courses to their numerous students and to people around the word through MOOC platforms. However, because of huge number of learners and data generated, learner's behaviour in those platforms remain a kind of black box for learners themselves and for courses instructors who are supposed to tutor or monitor learners in the learning process. Therefore, learner do not receive sufficient support from instructors and from their peers, during the learning process [2]. This is one the main reasons that lead to high dropout, low completion and success rate observed in the MOOCs. Many research work have suggested descriptive, predictive and prescriptive models to address this issue, but most of these models focus on predicting dropout, completion and/or success, and do not generally pay enough attention to one of the key step (learner behaviour), that comes before, and can explain dropping out and failure. Our research aims to develop a deep learning model to predict learner behaviour (learner interactions) in the learning process, in order to equip learners and course instructors with insight understanding of the learner behaviour in the learning process. This specific paper will focus on analysing relevant algorithms to develop such model. For this analysis, we used data from UNESCO-IICBA (International Institute for Capacity Building in Africa) MOOC platform, designed for teacher training in Africa, and then we examine many types of features: geographical, social behavioural and learning behavioural features. Learner's behaviour being a time series Big data, we built the predictive model using Deep Learning algorithms for better performance and accuracy (Thanks to the power of deep learning) compared to baseline Machine learning algorithms. Time series data is best handled by recurrent neural networks (RNN) [3], so, we choose RNN and implemented/tested the three main architectures of RNN: Simple RNNs, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) RNNs and LSTM (Long short-term memory) RNNs. The models were trained using L2 Regularization, based on the predictions results, we unexpectedly found model with simple RNNs produced the best performance and accuracy on the dataset used than the other RNN architectures. We had couple of observations, example: we saw a correlation between video viewing and quiz behaviour and the participation of the learner to the learning process. This observation could allow teachers to provide meaningful support and guidance to at risk or less active students. We also observed that, the shorter the video or the quiz, the more the viewer. We conclude that we could use learner video or quiz viewing behaviour to predict his behaviour concerning other MOOC contents. These results suggest the need of deeper research on educational video and educational quiz designing for MOOCs.},

abstract={The eventual goal of our study is to help teachers who give lectures in universities and other educational organizations with advising them as well as to help the attending students in order to maximize the learning performance of student. In order to achieve this goal we take the model-based approach. We construct student's learning model at first, and then extract appropriate tips on teaching for teachers and on learning for students. In this paper, as an attempt in this approach, we analyze the text data which were obtained as answers to a term-end questionnaire in a course. Firstly we make a grouping of students based on a correspondence analysis of students and words from the answers to a question about the student's achievement in taking the course. Then we compare these student groups in combination with other data such as examination scores as achievement, and attendance and homework scores as effort, as well as the features of words used in the answered texts. We have found that the students who have good achievement scores often give the comments from a wider view than what they actually learned in the class. On the other hand the students who give the comments using those terms which were taught in the class tends to have low achievement scores. The methods for in-depth analysis used in this paper are supposed to be appropriate tools for complementing the results from using the big data analysis methods and need to be developed more toward the future.},

abstract={Many enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 (Internet of Things ‚ÄúIoT‚Äù, Cloud systems, Big Data Analytics) contribute to the creation of what is the Digital Twin or virtual twin of a physical process, that is a mathematical model capable of describing the process, product or service in a precise way in order to carry out analyses and apply strategies. Digital Twin models integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and analytics software with the data collected from the production plants to create digital simulation models that update when the parameters of the production processes or the working conditions change. This is a self-learning mechanism, which makes use of data collected from various sources (sensors that transmit operating conditions; experts, such as engineers with deep knowledge of the industrial domain; other similar machines or fleets of similar machines) and integrates also historical data relating to the past use of the machine. Starting from the virtual twin vision, simulation plays a key role within the Industry 4.0 transformation. Creating a virtual prototype has become necessary and strategic to raise the safety levels of the operators engaged in the maintenance phases, but above all the integration of the digital model with the IoT has become particularly effective, as the advent of software platforms offers the possibility of integrating real-time data with all the digital information that a company owns on a given process, ensuring the realization of the Digital Twin. In this context, this work aims at developing optimized solutions for application in a beverage pasteurization system using the Digital Twin approach, capable of creating a virtual modelling of the process and preventing high-risk events for operators.},

abstract={Learning analytics has attracted a remarkable attention in the last years due to its potential to support and improve the learning experience. The first step of the learning analytics process is the educational data collection, therefore it is highly significant to track and collect the big educational data generated (learning data, assessment data, communication data etc). Assessment data represent an important proportion of the educational data generated. When we focus on assessment, we can launch a new source of data that can be analyzed and hence contribute to the improvement of the field of learning analytics. In this paper, we will focus on assessment data by proposing an assessment analytics architecture. This architecture uses the semantic web technologies and focus essentially on analyzing the set of assessment activities, the assessment result and the assessment context. These assessment data are conceived and annotated via an ontological model, inspired from the xAPI data model, which enable performing logic rules for supporting inference mechanisms related to assessment analytics and especially concerning the concrete level of the assessment actor and the level of difficulty of the assessment object.},

abstract={The massive online open course (MOOC) revolution offers opportunities for learning analytics regarding the diversity in learning activities of MOOCs. In MOOCs, video lectures represent the principal learning resource, and learners spend most of their time engaged in self-paced, independent learning. Therefore, MOOCs present an innovative form of video-based learning. How to improve this learning environment by adding additional features to video lectures represents a path for progress. Few studies have investigated the interaction between learners and the video content; however, improvement in this domain is necessary. This paper proposes a video-based learning analysis approach called VideoMark, which enables learners to judiciously review, consolidate, and clarify specific concepts introduced in MOOCs. This analytical approach can be applied to MOOC-style ShareCourse programs in Taiwan. Finally, this analytical approach is presented as a visual keyword cloud for learners to clarify specific learning concepts in the MOOC learning process.},

abstract={Large-scale graph and machine learning analytics widely employ distributed iterative processing. Typically, these analytics are a part of a comprehensive workflow, which includes data preparation, model building, and model evaluation. General-purpose distributed dataflow frameworks execute all steps of such workflows holistically. This holistic view enables these systems to reason about and automatically optimize the entire pipeline. Here, graph and machine learning analytics are known to incur a long runtime since they require multiple passes over the data until convergence is reached. Thus, fault tolerance and a fast-recovery from any intermittent failure is critical for efficient analysis. In this paper, we propose novel fault-tolerant mechanisms for graph and machine learning analytics that run on distributed dataflow systems. We seek to reduce checkpointing costs and shorten failure recovery times. For graph processing, rather than writing checkpoints that block downstream operators, our mechanism writes checkpoints in an unblocking manner that does not break pipelined tasks. In contrast to the conventional approach for unblocking checkpointing (e.g., that manage checkpoints independently for immutable datasets), we inject the checkpoints of mutable datasets into the iterative dataflow itself. Hence, our mechanism is iteration-aware by design. This simplifies the system architecture and facilitates coordinating checkpoint creation during iterative graph processing. Moreover, we are able to rapidly rebound, via confined recovery, by exploiting the fact that log files exist locally on healthy nodes and managing to avoid a complete recomputation from scratch. In addition, we propose replica recovery for machine learning algorithms, whereby we employ a broadcast variable that enables us to quickly recover without having to introduce any checkpoints. In order to evaluate our fault tolerance strategies, we conduct both a theoretical study and experimental analyses using Apache Flink and discover that they outperform blocking checkpointing and complete recovery.},

abstract={This study aims to increase ETL process efficiency and reduce processing time by applying the method of Change Data Capture (CDC) in distributed system using Hadoop Distributed file System (HDFS) and Apache Spark in the data warehouse of Learning Analytics system of Universitas Indonesia. Usually, increases in I lie number of records in the data source result in an increase in ETL processing time for the data warehouse system. This condition occurs as a result of inefficient ETL process using the full load method. Using the full load method, ETL has to process the same number of records as the number of records in the data sources. The proposed ETL model design with the application of CDC method using HDFS and Apache Spark can reduce the amount of data in the ETL process. Consequently, the process becomes more efficient and the ETL processing time Is reduced approximately 53% in average.},

abstract={The need for training students in presentation skills has been proposed. Skills in the creation, elaboration of slides are particularly important but it is actually difficult to train students in such skills. It is important for students to properly understand defective portions in slides so that they can polish the slides by themselves. However, it is difficult for novices to detect defective portions, it generally depends on individual work by experienced people such as professors. Such work imposes a huge burden on professors, prevents detailed guidance including the linkage of oral explanations, gestures, slide descriptions. This research was aimed at developing a mechanism for extracting the defective portions in slides, providing them to students on the basis of hybrid analysis of two promising sources: (1) constitutive features being inherent in the slide data, (2) audiences' visual tracking behaviors of slide content. This paper mainly describes methods of extracting candidates for problems from presentation slides that inhibit understanding by audiences on the basis of constitutive features of slides, audience gaze.},

abstract={This Research Full Paper presents the approach of traditional engineering analysis techniques on education. Data mining techniques have been successfully employed to extract hidden information from large data sets within various contexts. We hypothesized that data mining techniques can similarly be applied to large educational data sets to extract and analyze patterns and create insights. Specifically, we examined the degree to which standard data mining techniques can distinguish between different student attention patterns in large lectures in which personal computers were actively used. Our data set consists of electronically captured student attention data (on-task, off-task) that was recorded at 20 second intervals throughout each course lecture over one semester. With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, methods involved capturing student data via a backend monitoring system to reduce student awareness of monitoring and reduce false behavior changes during data collection periods. The data were originally captured in the form of images (screenshots), and image processing techniques were applied to extract student attention patterns in the form of zero (off-task) and one (on-task). We conducted descriptive statistical analysis to add other features such as characterization information (e.g., total logged in attention, average class period attention to the recorded data sets). For the data mining analysis, we used three different supervised machine learning classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classifying the students' dataset. We classified the students into one of four different classes based on their attention pattern in the lecture class. Before applying each classification algorithm, feature extraction was performed. For this purpose, we used Haar wavelets, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) dimensionality-reduction techniques before applying the classification algorithm. Their performance is compared. Our results indicate high classification accuracies can be obtained using these dimensional reduction algorithms followed by classification algorithms. Our result highlights the importance of applying traditional engineering analysis techniques to educational data in order to provide engineering education insights.},

abstract={E-learning is a response to the new educational needs of society and an important development in information and communication technologies because it represents the future of the teaching and learning processes. However, this trend presents many challenges, such as the processing of online forums which generate a huge number of messages with an unordered structure and a great variety of topics. These forums provide an excellent platform for learning and connecting students of a subject but the difficulty of following and searching the vast volume of information that they generate may be counterproductive. The main goal of this paper is to review the approaches and techniques related to online courses in order to present a set of learning analytics techniques and a general architecture that solve the main challenges found in the state of the art by managing them in a more efficient way: 1) efficient tracking and monitoring of forums generated; 2) design of effective search mechanisms for questions and answers in the forums; and 3) extraction of relevant key performance indicators with the objective of carrying out an efficient management of online forums. In our proposal, natural language processing, clustering, information retrieval, question answering, and data mining techniques will be used.},

abstract={Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have been experiencing increasing use and popularity in highly ranked universities in recent years. The opportunity of accessing high quality courseware content within such platforms, while eliminating the burden of educational, financial, and geographical obstacles has led to a rapid growth in participant numbers. The increasing number and diversity of participating learners has opened up new horizons to the research community for the investigation of effective learning environments. Learning Analytics has been used to investigate the impact of engagement on student performance. However, the extensive literature review indicates that there is little research on the impact of MOOCs, particularly in analyzing the link between behavioral engagement and motivation as predictors of learning outcomes. In this paper, we consider a dataset, which originates from online courses provided by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, delivered through the edX platform. Two sets of empirical experiments are conducted using both statistical and machine learning techniques. Statistical methods are used to examine the association between engagement level and performance, including the consideration of learner educational backgrounds. The results indicate a significant gap between success and failure outcome learner groups, where successful learners are found to read and watch course material to a higher degree. Machine learning algorithms are used to automatically detect learners who are lacking in motivation at an early time in the course, thus providing instructors with insight in regards to student withdrawal.},

abstract={The use of technology in education has risen so rapidly that many of the e-learning tools have become a great source for data gathering. In response to the growth, learning analytics are developed to extract the meaning from extensively large datasets and optimize learning opportunities for learners. Understanding users' behaviors is one of the key factors that can help educational institutes improve their curriculum design or non-instructional intervention. This paper, therefore, explores LMS's user behaviors through the study of courses' periodic behaviors. It assumes that there is a weekly pattern in most college-level courses where classes meet on a weekly basis, and that the pattern is reflected through the number of daily activities the courses produce. Courses that share similar weekly patterns are grouped into the same cluster using an unsupervised clustering algorithm. The knowledge obtained from the clustering can be used to describe the pattern in other courses. This paper continues to demonstrate one of course periodic modelling's applications by proposing a method to predict the activities that occur in an LMS. As a result, the weekly pattern found in each course, when aggregated, can represent the weekly behavior of the overall system. It can also predict the future trend of activities with correct shape and accuracy within the range of 82-86 percent.},

abstract={The current tendency of human learning and teaching is targeted to development and integration of digital technologies (like cloud solutions, mobile technology, learning analytics, big data, augmented reality, natural interaction technologies, etc.). Our Science Gateway (http://scigate.imp.kiev.ua) in collaboration with High Performance Computing Center (http://hpcc.kpi.ua) is aimed on the close cooperation among the main actors in learning and researching world (teachers, students, scientists, supporting personnel, volunteers, etc.) with industry and academia to propose the new frameworks and interoperability requirements for the building blocks of a digital ecosystem for learning (including informal learning) that develops and integrates the current and new tools and systems. It is the portal for management of distributed courses (workflows), tools, resources, and users, which is constructed on the basis of the Liferay framework and gUSE/WS-PGRADE technology. It is based on development of multi-level approach (as to methods/algorithms) for effective study and research through flexible selection and combination of unified modules (‚Äúgaming‚Äù with modules as with LEGO-bricks). It allows us to provide the flexible and adjustable framework with direct involvement in real-world and scientific use cases motivated by the educational aims of students and real scientific aims in labs.},
