abstract = {We propose three extensions for the relational event framework to model the co-evolution of multiple network event streams which are increasingly available thanks to the explosive growth of online applications. Firstly, a flexible stratification approach is considered to allow for more complex data structures with many types of nodes and events. Secondly, an inference method that combines nested case–control sampling with stratification is discussed to scale the approach to very large data sets. Finally, a suite of new temporal and network statistics is introduced to reflect the potentially complex dependencies among events and observed heterogeneities on nodes and edges. The empirical value of new extensions is demonstrated through an analysis of social learning in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In particular, three modeling problems are considered from the network perspective: (1) the utility of social factors, performance indicators, and clickstream behaviors in the prediction of course dropout, (2) the social and temporal structure of learner interactions across discussion threads, and (3) the forms of mutual dependence of social learning interactions on prior learning success, and future learning success on forms of prior social learning interaction.}

Today's CL platforms allow students for performing many online activities, thus generating a huge mass of data that can be processed to provide insights about the level of satisfaction on contents, services, community interactions, and effort. Big Data is a suitable paradigm for real-time processing of large data sets concerning the LS, in the final aim to provide valuable information that may improve the CL experience. Besides, the adoption of Big Data offers the opportunity to implement a non-intrusive and in-process evaluation strategy of online courses that complements the traditional and time-consuming ways to collect feedback (e.g. questionnaires or surveys). Although the application of Big Data in the CL domain is a recent explored research area with limited applications, it may have an important role in the future of online education. By adopting the design science research methodology, this article describes a novel method and approach to analyse individual students' contributions in online learning activities and assess the level of their satisfaction towards the course. A software artefact is also presented, which leverages Learning Analytics in a Big Data context, with the goal to provide in real-time valuable insights that people and systems can use to intervene properly in the program. The contribution of this paper can be of value for both researchers and practitioners: the former can be interested in the approach and method used for LS assessment; the latter can find of interest the system implemented and how it has been tested in a real online course.}

abstract = {Technology enhanced learning (TEL) such as online learning environment with adaptive technologies has gained growing interest in recent past in the field of teaching and learning. In this context, mobile learning has got much momentum and is exemplified by diverse characteristics associated with the technologies and devices used, the enormous size of data generated throughout a learning session, and the interactions among the learners that occur outside the classroom. Consequently, sophisticated data analysis techniques are required to handle the intricacy of mobile learning and analyze the vast amount of datasets to enhance the learning experiences of mobile learners. This has led to the adoption of big data analytics for efficient processing of big learning data to add value to the mobile learning environments. Yet limited processing capability of the mobile devices is another key challenge faced by such big data analytics in mobile learning environments. To overcome this limitation, certain heavy computational parts could be offloaded to the cloud which can provide enough computation and storage resources. To this end, this paper presents a cloud based mobile learning framework that utilizes big data analytics technique to extract values from huge volume of mobile learners' data. Finally, we investigate learners' readiness and driving factors of mobile learning adoption in higher education institutions. In particular, we propose a hypothesized model for mobile learning adoption built on a locally extended technology acceptance model (TAM).}

This article shows a proposal for creating an information system based on Academic Analytics, designing a model that is supported by Academic Analytics for the collection and analysis of data from the information systems of educational institutions. The idea that was conceived proposes a system that is capable of displaying statistics on the historical data of students and teachers taken over academic periods, with the purpose of gathering the information that the director, the teacher, and finally the student need for making decisions. The model was validated with information taken from students and teachers during the last five years, and the export format of the data was pdf, csv, and xls files. The findings allow us to state that it is extremely important to analyze the data that is in the information systems of the educational institutions for making decisions. After the validation of the model, it was established that it is a must for students to know the reports of their academic performance in order to carry out a process of self-evaluation, as well as for teachers to be able to see the results of the data obtained in order to carry out processes of self-evaluation, and adaptation of content and dynamics in the classrooms.}

Both, Big and Small data techniques support the analysis cycle of learning analytics and risk of students’ failure prediction. Such possibilities can be a strong positive contribution to the field of computational practice such as programming. Our main objective was to help teachers in their assessments through to make those possibilities effective. Thus, we have developed a functional solution to categorize and understand students’ behavior in programming activities based in Scratch. Through collection and analysis of data generated by students’ clicks in Scratch, we proceed to execute both exploratory and predictive analytics to detect patterns in students’ behavior when developing solutions for assignments. We concluded that resultant taxonomy could help teachers to better support their students by giving real-time quality feedback and act before students deliver incorrectly or at least incomplete tasks.}

This study deploys a deep artificial neural network on a set of unique handcrafted features, extracted from the virtual learning environments clickstream data, to predict at-risk students providing measures for early intervention of such cases. The results show the proposed model to achieve a classification accuracy of 84%–93%. We show that a deep artificial neural network outperforms the baseline logistic regression and support vector machine models. While logistic regression achieves an accuracy of 79.82%–85.60%, the support vector machine achieves 79.95%–89.14%. Aligned with the existing studies - our findings demonstrate the inclusion of legacy data and assessment-related data to impact the model significantly. Students interested in accessing the content of the previous lectures are observed to demonstrate better performance. The study intends to assist institutes in formulating a necessary framework for pedagogical support, facilitating higher education decision-making process towards sustainable education.}

As students interacted, either individually or in groups, we aimed to discover their social communities given the temporal and spatial co-occurrence of their activities and their implicit user–system interactions. To elicit those hidden communities, we developed two innovative approaches: history-based analysis, which exploits the similarity of users’ histories of engaging in certain activities, and session-based analysis, which uses a graph-based representation of concurrent users’ activity sessions. We tested and validated both approaches using a real-world dataset representing the activity logs of students using a virtual learning environment platform. The major results of our work confirm that the co-occurrence of people’s activities is an emerging epiphenomenon of hidden, implicit exchanges of information in side-channel communications.}

This study investigates how personality differences within learners can affect computer based learning, through a comprehensive review of the literature.

However, with the ever-increasing number of videos, it has become challenging to arrange and search them according to specific categories. In this paper, we get around the problem by bridging Learning Analytics and Cognitive Computing to analyze the content of large video collections, going over traditional term-based methods. We propose an efficient and effective approach to automatically classify a collection of educational videos on pre-existing categories which uses (i) a Speech-to-Text tool to get video transcripts, (ii) Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing methods to extract semantic concepts and keywords from video transcripts for their representation, and (iii) Apache Spark as Big Data technology for scalability. Several classifiers are trained on the feature vectors extracted by Cognitive Computing tools. Then, we compared our approach with other combinations of state-of-the-art feature types and classifiers over a large-scale dataset we collected from Coursera. Considering the experimental results, we expect our approach can facilitate the development of Learning Analytics tools powered by Cognitive Computing to support content managers on micro-learning video management while improving how learners search videos.}

Big data analytics are becoming more prevalent due to the recent availability of health data. Yet in spite of evidence supporting the potential contribution of big data analytics to health policy makers and care providers, these tools are still too complex to be routinely used. Further, access to comprehensive datasets required for more accurate results is complex and costly. Consequently, big data analytics are mostly used by researchers and experts who are far removed from actual clinical practice. Hence, policy makers should allocate resources to encourage studies that clarify and simplify big data analytics so it can be used by non-experts (e.g., clinicians, practitioners and decision-makers who may not have advanced computer skills). It is also important to fund data collection and integration from various health IT, a pre-condition for any big data analytics project.
Objectives
To methodologically clarify the rationale and logic behind several analytics algorithms to help non-expert users employ big data analytics by understanding how to implement relatively easy to use platforms as Azure ML.
Methods
We demonstrate the predictive power of four known algorithms and compare their accuracy in predicting early mortality of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) patients.
Results
The results of our models outperform those reported in the literature, attesting to the strength of some of the models, and the utility of comprehensive data.
Conclusions
The results support our call to policy makers to allocate resources to establishing comprehensive, integrated health IT systems, and to projects aimed at simplifying ML analytics.}

A new line of research has been opened relating to the analysis of student behavior within an LMS, in the search for patterns that improve the learning process. Current e-learning platforms allow for recording student activity, thereby enabling the exploration of events generated in the use of LMS tools. This paper presents a case study conducted at the Catholic University of Murcia, where student behavior in the past four academic years was analyzed according to learning modality (that is, on-campus, online, and blended), considering the number of accesses to the LMS, tools employed by students and their associated events. Given the difficulty of managing the large volume of data generated by users in the LMS (up to 70 GB in this study), statistical and association rule techniques were performed using a Big Data framework, thus speeding up the statistical analysis of the data. The obtained results are demonstrated using visual analytic techniques, and evaluated in order to detect trends and deficiencies in the use of the LMS by students.}

However, the question is how to deal with this amount of data. To this end, visual analytics is a combination of computational techniques from data mining and machine learning with human perceptional methods from human-computer interaction. In this article we present a method and tool support to create rich and interactive visual analytics charts to analyze innovative training solutions in high-tech workplace settings. This brings together the computer's capacities to handle large data and calculation resources with the human ability to quickly grasp relationships.

Is there any relevant student data available to HEIs on the basis of which they could predict the student success rate? The answers to the above research questions can generally be obtained using data mining tools. Unfortunately, data mining algorithms work best with large data sets, while student data, available to HEIs, related to courses are limited and falls into the category of small data sets.
